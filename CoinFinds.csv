The colony was established with Latin rights by the triumvirate of Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius, and Lucius Manlius Acidinus. Roads soon connected Aquileia with the Roman colony of Bologna probably in 173 BC. In 148 BC, it was connected with Genua by the Via Postumia, which stretched across the Padanian plain from Aquileia through or near to Opitergium, Tarvisium, Vicetia, Verona, Bedriacum, and the three Roman colonies of Cremona, Placentia, and Dertona. The construction of the Via Popilia from the Roman colony of Ariminium to Ad Portum near Altinum in 132 BC improved communications still further. In the 1st century AD, the Via Gemina would link Aquileia with Emona to the east of the Julian Alps, and by 78 or 79 AD the Via Flavia would link Aquileia to Pula. In 90 BC, the original Latin colony became a municipium and its citizens were ascribed to the Roman tribe Velina. The customs boundary of Italy was close by in Cicero’s day. Caesar visited the city on a number of occasions and pitched winter camp nearby in 59-58 BC. Augustus was the first of a number of emperors to visit Aquileia, notably during the Pannonian wars in 12‑10 BC. It was the birthplace of Tiberius’ son by Julia, in the latter year. The Roman poet Martial praised Aquileia as his hoped-for haven and resting place in his old age. In the war against the Marcomanni in 167, the town was hard pressed; its fortifications had fallen into disrepair during the long peace. Nevertheless, when in 168 Marcus Aurelius made Aquileia the principal fortress of the empire against the barbarians of the North and East, it rose to the pinnacle of its greatness and soon had a population of 100,000. Septimius Severus visited in 193. In 238, when the town took the side of the Senate against the Emperor Maximinus Thrax, the fortifications were hastily restored, and proved of sufficient strength to resist for several months, until Maximinus himself was assassinated. An imperial palace was constructed in Aquileia, in which the emperors after the time of Diocletian frequently resided. During the 4th century, Aquileia maintained its importance. Constantine I sojourned there on numerous occasions. It became a naval station and the seat of the Corrector Venetiarum et Histriae; a mint was established, of which the coins were very numerous, and the Catholic bishop obtained the rank of metropolitan archbishop. A council held in the city in 381 was only the first of a series of Councils of Aquileia that have been convened over the centuries. However, the city played a part in the struggles between the rulers of the 4th century. In 340, Emperor Constantine II was killed nearby while invading the territory of his younger brother Constans. At the end of the 4th century, Ausonius enumerated Aquileia as the ninth among the great cities of the world. However, such prominence made it a target and Alaric and the Visigoths besieged it in 401, during which time some of its residents fled to the nearby lagoons. Alaric again attacked it in 408. Attila attacked the city in 452. During this invasion, on July 18, Attila and his Huns so utterly destroyed the city that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site. The fall of Aquileia was the first of Attila’s incursions into Roman territory; followed by cities like Mediolanum and Ticinum. Aquileia would rise again and continue to exist until the Lombards invaded in 568; the Lombards destroyed it a second time in 590.

The Roman settlement was identified via the mansio Hadriani, a second century BC post office located at the point where via Popillia, coming from Rimini, headed for Adria, whereas a coastal route went on to Loreo in later times. Between late 4th and early 5th century AD, San Basilio was the site of a Paleochristian community; a cathedral with a baptistery was built, which is still visible in the archaeological area open to the public. A small necropolis with inhumation burials was also connected to the church. As for the church, only the perimeter wall and the southern part of the apse facing east have been identified, and therefore the current state of research cannot define its layout. The baptistery is of the type with octagonal layout and central basin and apse on the eastern side; it was connected to the church perhaps via some arcades, which must have been functional to the complex rituals of baptism. A large monumental building datable to the Roman Empire (2nd-3rd centuries AD) can be seen in the archaeological area.

The exact location of the hoard is unknown, and the possible locations are  discussed in Govaars et al. 2009, 42. ""Because the hoard contained coins with the portrait of Julian II Caesar, [Avi-Yonah] concluded that the hoard was hidden in 355 CE and that the building was destroyed in the middle of the fourth century. Avi-Yonah gave no reason for the destruction of Stratum IV. According to Avi-Yonah the Stratum IV synagogue was founded at the end of the third or the early fourth century"" (Raphael and Bijovsky 2014, 177). Based on the photographs taken of the coins in situ (Govaars et al. 2009, 48-51), the coins were estimated as being scattered in an area approximately 30 x 30 cm.","10/23/2022 7:35:31 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=14707","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/14707","11/23/2024"

K-2","CHRE","//  Archaeology site comment: The region of Carnuntum was settled by the Celtic tribe of the Boii in the first two centuries BC. After the Boii had settled as far as the Vienna Woods there were border disputes and military conflicts with the Dacians under King Burebista in the 40s of the first century BC, which ended in a devastating defeat of the Boii. After a short Dacian rule, the region came under the control of regnum Noricum and in 15 BC was annexed by the Romans along with the kingdom of Noricum. The first presence of the Romans in the Carnuntum area shortly after the turn of the eras is to be seen in connection with the masterplan of Augustan imperial politics in the creation of a provinceof Germania. The Illyrian occupying army of the Romans under the then general and later emperor Tiberius took part in the campaign against the Marcomanni under King Marbod. According to V. Paterculus, Carnuntum is first mentioned in AD 6, as a Celtic town, where a winter camp has been erected. The 18 ha of Carnuntum’s military camp were situated on a kind of elevated plateau on the south bank of the Danube. According to the archaeological evidence, a wood-earth camp was erected under Emperor Claudius around AD 40/50 by the legio XV Apollinaris.The building of a stone camp wall, which replaced the older wood-earth fortifications, was probably erected by soldiers of the 15th legion, as substantiated by several building blocks with inscriptions by centuries. The canabae legionis came into being, which at its largest covered a builtup area of about 120 ha during the Severan dynasty. A further military camp with a troop of 480 auxiliary cavalries was stationed here. This auxiliary fort was built in Flavian times as an almost 4 ha wood-earth camp and was reconstructed for the most part in stone during the first decades of the 2nd century AD. Under Emperor Hadrian the city was officially raised to the status of municipium Aelium Karnuntum. The city was allocated to the tribus Sergia. A first period of prosperity under the emperors Hadrian (AD 117–138) and Antoninus Pius (AD 138–161) is presented in the building of individual insulae. This period of prosperity was interrupted by the outbreak of the Marcomanni wars during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. On the 9th of April 193, the Rhine and Danube troops proclaimed as emperor L. Septimius Severus, who was at that time legatus Augusti pro praetore Pannoniae Superioris, and thus governor of Upper Pannonia. The acclamation took place in Carnuntum. Carnuntum was honoured by being raised to the status of a colonia - colonia Septimia Aurelia Antoniniana Karnuntum. In the second half of the year AD 260 Publius C(assius?) Regalianus, the governor of Illyricum or more probably of Upper Pannonia, was proclaimed anti-emperor by the Danube troops instead of the actual incumbent Emperor Gallienus (AD 253–268). But towards the end of the year Regalianus perished, presumably killed by his own troops who feared punishment by ruling Emperor Gallienus. Despite internal unrest and the threats from outside the Empire, Carnuntum continued to prosper, for west Pannonia apparently remained unharmed by invading Germanic tribes. After Diocletian and Maximianus resigned on the 1st of May AD 305, there were soon problems with the succession, which were to be solved in Carnuntum. On the 11th of November AD 308 the Emperors’ Conference took place in Carnuntum, where the aim was to uphold the tetrarchy and where Licinius was named the new Augustus of the west. In contrast to other cities, Carnuntum was very prosperous in the late 3rd and in the first half of the 4th century and enjoyed a late flourishing. Around AD 365/70, an earthquake caused great damage in the city. Features in the excavations show large-scale destruction. Emperor Valentinian I, stayed in Carnuntum in the year AD 374 The last written evidence of Carnuntum in ancient literature is to be found in Ammianus Marcellinus’ writings, where he describes the city as desertum quidem nunc et squalens, abandoned and squalid. The Huns pressed forward in the west, the Alemanni invaded Raetia on the Rhine. In AD 433 Pannonia was taken over by the Hun king Attila. The Carnuntum region was settled piecemeal during the migration of peoples, but the civilian city and the military camp with the canabae legionis became visibly deserted.","10/23/2022 7:46:51 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=14991","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/14991","11/23/2024"

Domitius Corbulo, who was interested in the traffic between the Meuse and Rhine. Ceuclum was situated on a small hill, an ancient river dune. Two (or three?) ditches of this first fort, which measured some 150x120 meters and must have offered accommodation to some 500 soldiers. Fort Ceuclum may have monitored the Batavians in the north and west. There is no real evidence for its destruction during the Batavian revolt (although there are traces of a burning layer), which suggests that it was evacuated when the news of the rebellion arrived. After 70, the garrison seems to have moved to another place. In the second century, the villagers constructed on the site of the former fort a building that has been interpreted as a sanctuary; it measured 17½ x 16½ meters. A smaller temple was found in the neighborhood. Another building in the vicus that has been identified is the bathhouse. The village measured some 6-10 hectares, which suggests that there were some 500-750 people living at Ceuclum. In AD 274, Ceuclum suffered heavily from the Franks raids: the two cemeteries (to the south and northwest of the village) were not used after AD 275. The fortification was renewed during the reign of Constantine I. The new fort was situated at the same site as the first one, and was almost the same size. It was surrounded by an earth and timber rampart. Inside was a large granary. In 406, troops were transferred from the Rhine frontier to Italy, and in the first days of 407, Germanic tribes crossed the river. Roman control of the Rhine area was never restored, and the new, Frankish authorities took control of the area.

Following the Punic Wars, it was refounded as a Roman town and probably received some of Julius Caesar’s veterans as settlers in 45 BC. Its greatest importance occurred under the Severan dynasty in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. Septimius Severus raised Thysdrus to municipality status with partial Roman citizenship. By the early 3rd century when its huge amphitheater was built, Thysdrus rivaled Hadrumetum (present-day Sousse) as the second city of Roman North Africa, after Carthage. The city had even a huge circus, nearly as large as the Circus Maximus at Rome and capable of accommodating about 30,000 spectators. In AD 238, Thysdrus was at the center of a struggle to control the Roman Empire. Gordian I assumed both the purple and the epithet Africanus (""the African"") on March 22. Due to his advanced age, he insisted that his son M. Antonius Gordianus – Gordian II - be acclaimed as his co-ruler. The governor of Numidia, Capelianus, a loyal supporter of Maximinus I Thrax invaded the province of Africa with the only legion stationed in the region and other veteran units. Gordian II, at the head of a militia army of untrained soldiers mostly from Thysdrus and surroundings, lost the Battle of Carthage and was killed. Gordian I took his own life in his villa near Carthage. Following this abortive revolt, Capelianus’s troops sacked Thysdrus. Thysdrus was subsequently raised to the level of a colony (colonia) by Gordian III in AD 244. It was the seat of a Christian diocese, which is included in the Catholic Church’s list of titular sees. All the same, it never really recovered.

During the Iron Age Este was a major center of the Veneti who left a number of inscriptions on funerary and votive objects. During the late 3rd century BC, Este peacefully fell under the sway of Rome and became a Roman colony under the name of Ateste. When much of Northern Italy was granted Roman citizenship in 49 BC, the citizens of Este were inscribed into the Roman tribe of Romilia. Following the Battle of Actium, Augustus settled soldiers of the Legio V Alaudae and Legio XI Claudia in the territory of Este comprising Galzignano, Teolo, Lonigo, Noventa Vicentina, Trecenta, Pernumia, Monselice, and Cinto Euganeo. In Late Antiquity, Este was devastated and reduced to a rural village because of barbarian invasions, especially that of Attila.

It was initially not recognized and consequently scattered by the construction machinery. Nevertheless, with the help of metal detectors, 636 nummi could be found and identified as belonging to this hoard. Other nine coins from private collections belong to this hoard.//  Archaeology site comment: The Celto-Roman dwelling on the banks of the Mur river that should later become Flavia Solva was founded around year 15 while Noricum was still a Roman protectorate. Shortly after the annexation of Noricum as a Roman province, the place was made a municipium around year 70 by emperor Vespasian who added the name of his Flavian dynasty to the local name Solva. The construction activity that followed resulted in an almost entirely new city of stone buildings, with a layout that approximated the ideal of a Roman provincial municipium: rectangular insulae (sized about 60 by 70 meters) within a grid of broad (ca. 6 m) gravel-paved streets. Flavia Solva and its surroundings had developed a modest degree of provincial luxury, with the villa rustica as the typical form of aristocratic countryside residence and agricultural cultivation, when its peaceful development was ended by its first destruction in 166. At this time the Marcomanni breached the Danube Limes between the fortifications of Vindobona (modern Vienna) and Carnuntum, penetrated northwestern Pannonia and eastern Noricum using the Roman road system tracing the ancient Amber Road along the eastern fringe of the Alps, and could be stopped by emperor Marcus Aurelius’s hastily assembled militia only shortly before reaching Aquileia. Flavia Solva was rebuilt under Marcus Aurelius’s son and successor Commodus, and flourished again a few decades later. Flavia Solva lost much of its importance during the late 4th century when the region suffered more incursions. The city was destroyed again in 405, but some isolated finds referring to emperor Marcian suggest that a residual settlement must have remained at least until the 450s.

The settlement was elevated to municipium in AD 64/65 and to colonia under Trajan (AD 98 –117) during the rule of Nero. it was greatly expanded under the Roman emperor Septimius Severus (AD 193–211), who was a native of the city. Diocletian re-instated the city as provincial capital, and the city grew in prosperity until it fell to the Vandals in AD 439. It was re-incorporated into the Eastern Empire in AD 533, but continued to be plagued by Berber raids and never recovered its former importance. It fell to the Muslim invasion in c. AD 647 and it was abandoned.

The core of the civilian settlement, which was never awarded the status of a town, was located west of the main modern traffic route running from the Main Square to the nearer end of the Landstrasse, known as the canabae. A sacred district with a mithraeum was uncovered in the Tummelplatz.The settlement was destroyed on several occasions by attacks by the Goths in the second century; a residual settlement from the late antiquity on the Martinsfeld withstood the storms of the barbarian invasions.

Emona was the region’s easternmost city, although it was assumed formerly that it was part of the Pannonia or Illyricum, but archaeological findings from 2008 proved otherwise. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana.The Visigoths camped by Emona in the winter of 408/9, the Huns attacked it during their campaign of 452, the Langobards passed through on their way to Italy in 568, and then came incursions by the Avars and Slavs."" (Wikipedia/Emona)//  Rating comment: The coins can be described at the coin data level following the article by Miskenc, A.","10/23/2022 7:35:11 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=14693","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/14693","11/23/2024"

The chronicles mention that the Kingdom of Iberia and its capital were conquered by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC. Eventually, the ruler appointed by Alexander ruined the walls of Mtskheta and left only four fortresses, one of them known today as Armazi. Both the excavations and The Georgian chronicles mention considerable construction in the Hellenistic period: residential houses, palaces and fortifications. New wall around Mtskheta was built by the first Georgian King Parnavaz in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, and later strengthened by his son Saurmag in the late 3rd - beginning of 2nd century BC. In the end of the 2nd century - beginning of the 1st, the King Parnajom strengthened his relations with Persians and invited Zoroastrian priests to settle in Mtskheta. This probably led to construction of Zoroastrian temples in the city. Meanwhile, no such archeological evidences exist. The walls of Mtskheta were improved during the reign of Bartom in the 1st century BC, and later also by Aderki, often identified with Pharasmanes I. The latter king is associated with appearance of first Christian communities in Kartli and arrival of the Holy Tunic to Mtskheta, brought from Jerusalem by local Jews.

Two pots of coarse grey ware had been buried side by side a short distance below the surface; their rims, broken away by the plough, were missing.<br />Apart from a handful of earlier coins extending back to Gallienus, the great bulk of the hoard was made up of the issues of Constantine the Great and his sons from about AD 320-347. The latest coins were five examples of the FEL TEMP REPARATIO types of Constantius II and Constans, so that the hoard must have been buried within the few years before 350. Although the coins had been removed from their containers by the finder, it was evident from the metal stains that each pot had held different-sized coins. One had contained over 1,650 Constantinian issues minted from about 320-326. All except about 100 were from the mint of London and were in very fine condition with their silver coating often intact. Of the coins of London those of Constantine II Caesar far outnumber those of Constantine I or Crispus. Among the remaining coins nearly all the imperial mints (except Alexandria) were represented by occasional specimens.<br />The second pot contained nearly 4,00 coins, of which the great majority were issued after 335; GLORIA EXERCITVS (one standard) and VICTORIAE DD AVGGQ NN far outnumber any other reverse type, and the great majority were struck at the mint of Trier. The very thin representation of types struck between 326 and 335 (GLORIA EXERCITVS (2 standards), VRBS ROMA, CONSTANTINOPOLIS) is remarkable.<br />The owner, Mr. F.G.

Brown, in an Appendix to ""A Roman Pewter Hoard from Appleford, Berks."" (1968) in Oxon., XXXVIII (1973), 184-206, noted that the Appleford hoard of coins was found in 1954, ""in Appleford Field at a point which must be about 200 yards north of the area of gravel working which produced the pewter"", and described and illustrated the two pots (204-6, figs.):<br />""The first pot (FIG. 10, A), is grey, quite pale in the break and hard, fired at a relatively high temperature. There is a cordon at the base of the neck; the mouth was probably curled over outwards till it was almost horizontal. The base and lower part of the body have been turned, the upper part of the body has been burnished and there is a rough band between them. There is also an unburnished decorative band flanked by grooves just above the belly of the pot.<br />The second pot (FIG. 10, B) seems to be in much the same fabric though it is darker on the surface and darker in the break. Details of the neck are missing. The turned and burnished areas overlap - as they were presumably intended to do - leaving only the single unburnished band around the belly; this is embellished with a burnished wavy line.<br />The general form of these vessels is best paralleled by a number of so-called handleless bottles from the Sandford kiln site (T. May, in Arch., LXXII (1921), 223-42), though the Sandford fabric is softer than these pieces. Hard, smooth-surfaced grey pottery like these two pieces is common in the region though not in dated contexts. Its use for containers for this coin hoard gives a firm date for its manufacture, in the second quarter of the 4th century.""<br />There followed a discussion whether pot A, containing the smaller, earlier part of the hoard was buried before the larger, later part, in pot B. If so, ""this would be an example of banking by burying, the careful saver having taken careful note of the position of his first hoard so that he was able to relocate it and add to it twenty years later.<br />And, from the way in which each hoard comes predominantly from a single mint, it looks as though he received his money en masse rather than by saving, perhaps as a gratuity, perhaps as pay."""" ******* Although the coins had been removed from their containers by the finder, it was evident from the metal stains that each pot had held different-sized coins. The coins were not separated out according to their containers in the catalogue, thought the split is said to have been chronological (with pre-330 coins in one jar and later ""and smaller"" coins in the other). The coins in the Ashmolean (catalogued) are thought to represent ""virtually the entire hoard"".

A ploughman turned up a pot and, hearing money inside, smashed the pot and carried home the coins, hoping they were of value. He kept it a secret for some time, and when eventually he showed them to a friend of mine, who told him they were worth only a few pence, he gave them to my friend, who in turn gave them to Ashwell Museum.

This appears in the HER record. The given reference (Beldam 1856-9) does not mention a hoard. It reports that coins that were 'probably Roman' were found by labourers working on the ditch the autumn before his excavations began. He recounts that Roman coins were frequently dug up at there, according to Camden but no coins were reported in this account of his own excavations. The ""enamelled shield-shaped fibula"" reported as having been found there in the HER record was reported by Dr. Lethbridge in the JRS in 1925 and is not connected to Beldam's excavation.","5/6/2021 11:05:41 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10322","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10322","11/23/2024"

But I think it may be regarded as a reasonable sample since the coins were certainly mixed up a good deal after the finding. It seems to me to be interesting for two matters (1) the absence of any coins of 375-378, and (2) the fact that none of the coins are clipped to a smaller size. This perhaps suggests that clipping began only with series 388-395.""<br />Professor Atkinson's list (with types, mints) comprised 1 ant. and 416 AE.

However, despite vigorous efforts they were unable to locate any additional pieces..<br />The complete hoard of 440 coins was brought back to the Ashmolean for detailed examination and listing.

    9Coin data quality rating: Poor (Grade 1)DescriptionRoman coin hoard: Nine 3rd-4th century coins fused together. The coins have been burnt, with some charcoal adhering to the corrosion products. The coins are visible in two stacks, one of the stacks has considerably more damage due to burning. Four coins are clearly visible in one stack, with one face exposed. No detail is visible on the exposed coin face - there is possibly a radiate crown, however this is uncertain due to the level of corrosion. The exposed coin has a diameter of 13.24mm. The amount of coins on the second stack is more difficult to assertain due to the fused and melted condition. This area appears to have four coins stacked on top of each other with corrosion products inbetween, a further coin joins the two stacks together. The remaining area of corrosion contains fragments of coins, however due to the burnt condition it is unclear whether these are part of the coins listed above, or are additional coins. It weighs 12.74 grams.Other PAS records associated with this hoard: ESS-962187NotesComment on PAS database: Conservator Emma Hogarth of Colchester & Ipswich Museum Service does not believe that an x-ray will provide any more information about the coins / number of coins. As we can only be certain of 9 coins, this group does not qualify as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), as 10 or more base metal coins need to be present. It is quite likely that these are either barbarous coins or blanks to be used for making barbarous coins. Such groups have been found before, for example at Lacock in Wiltshire where c. 15 such peices were found fused together. Image on PAS.Subsequent actions

The site covers at least 6 hectares (15 acres) and geophysical techniques indicate that it may be much larger. It is laid out on a fairly organised plan with post-built fences dividing the site up into sub-rectangular units. Most of the ceramic material is from the 3rd or 4th centuries, although there is some slightly earlier material. The large number of storage pits, ovens and driers suggest an economy dominated by grain production and storage. Finds from the site include over a thousand coins.<br />Some of the solidi were found in fragments of a small beaker and I am grateful to Val Rigby for providing the following description and drawing. There are six sherds which join to form an almost complete necked globular beaker (Fig. 1); the fracture edges are clean and fresh, indicating that the vessel was broken recently. The fabric is orange with a grey core and a matt brown slip. It is a product of the New Forest potteries in Hampshire, and can be classified as Fulford type 30.12. The basic form is considered to have been introduced around AD 300, with production continuing into the sixth century, so that the Boscombe Down hoard provides valuable evidence that this particular small, plain variant was among the latest colour-coated products of the New Forest industry..<br /><br />Gratian 1<br />Valentinian II 2<br />Honorius 4<br />Arcadius 1<br />A.

GLORIA EXERCITVS, 2 stand.) and one of Constantinopolis, which are labelled as coming from Breiddin Hill. Mr. O'Neil suggested that the coins were found, not on the east, but on the west side of the hill, for in about 1910, Mr. Jim Walton and a friend found a number of Roman coins (12 or more) ""half way up the hill on the north-west side at a spot now quarried away<br />on a ledge by an overhanging rock 'adjacent to an old lane' (probably only a footpath) 'which led up the crag, over a shoulder, and down again.'

Both these additional groups were also treated as Treasure Trove. The latest coins in the hoard are siliquae of Arcadius and Honorius minted at Milan between AD 394 and 402. Since at least 27 of the siliquae were clipped (14.4% of the total) the date of deposition is not likely to have been before c.AD 410.' . Since the publication in CHRB X, 18 additional siliquae have been reported from this hoard; see Treasure Annual Report 1997-98, 135 (2 siliquae, found in 1997) and Treasure Annual Report 1998-99, 316 (5 siliquae and 1 spoon fragment found in 1998) and Treasure Annual Report 2005-06, 1138 (11 siliquae found in 2006) = Hobbs 2006, 1481 CHRB X: 1 solidus (Eugenius); 174 siliquae and 1 half-siliqua (Constantius II, 8; Julian Caesar, 1; Julian Augustus, 14; Jovian, 1; Valentinian I, 5; Valentinian I or Valens, 1; Valens, 31; Gratian, 19; Valentinian II, 15 (1 irregular); Theodosius I, 13; Magnus Maximus , 21; Eugenius, 12; Arcadius, 20 (1 half-siliqua); Honorius, 21; uncertain, 4); 3 silver finger-rings, 7 fragments of silver spoons.

Initially they removed the coins from the site, an action which resulted in the loss of an unspecified number, but subsequently surrendered the great majority of them to the owner, Mrs. H. Marsh. Mrs. Marsh submitted them, together with the sherds of the pot which once contained them, to the Hampshire County Museum Service for identification.<br />The sherds form part of a New Forest grey ware jar or jug, with decoration in the form of vertical and horizontal grooves, and with saltire crosses scored on its body. This is a known type, catalogued by Fulford (BAR 17 (1975), fig. 33, 20.1). This form had a terminal date of c. AD 350, which is in close agreement with the termination date of the hoard. The sherds recovered constitute only part of the vessel; the rim and base are missing. While the base and body sherds exhibit fresh breaks, the neck is abraded and worn, presumably as a result of plough or cultivation damage. As it was not possible to view the find 'in situ', nor recover details of its discovery, this is the only clue to the manner of deposition. Two other small Roman sherds collected from the area of the find were also submitted for identification. They are from different vessels but both are also of New Forest type. After they had been identified, the coins were retained by the owner, but the pottery sherds were donated to the Museum Service, where they are housed as A1984.29.""<br />The hoard comprised AE coins - 484 regular issues of AD 320-48 and 126 irregular copies of types of AD 330-48 - making a total of 610.<br />The 484 regular coins were:<br />Trier Lyons Arles Rome Aq.

Jones observed a scatter of coins whilst ploughing on his farm at Cae Bardd, near Guilsfield, in the same field where 288 coins had come to light in 1935 [no. 1105]. A hole some 2m. in diameter was dug at the spot by Mr. Jones and members of his family, and this revealed two Roman earthenware vessels containing the bulk of the hoard. Several more coins scattered by the plough up to 10m. from the vessels were retrieved with the use of a metal detector. The coins, numbering some 4,102 were reported to Mr. K. Mason (then Curator of the Powysland Museum, Welshpool) in April 1982, and were brought to the National Museum of Wales for identification and study. Subsequently a further 614 scattered coins came to light and are included in the catalogue. Therefore, 4,716 coins have been identified, a total probably not far off the number originally buried.<br />The two earthenware containers were found buried just below the surface. The upper parts of both vessels had been disturbed by the plough, and sherds from these scattered. Although it was possible to reconstruct both vessels to some extent, the only rim sherd to be collected came from the globular beaker. Circular impressions of the coins remain on the interior surface of both vessels.<br />1. Lower half of a storage jar in an orange fabric with a grey core. There are traces of exterior burnishing but most of this has been removed by over-zealous cleaning. This vessel is probably an example of Severn Valley ware, but unfortunately not enough survives for a positive identification by its form. However, the spot where it was found is well within the area where products of this ware were being distributed in the fourth century AD.<br />2. Most of a globular beaker in an orange-brown fabric with a thin buff core and a darker red-brown exterior slip, most of which has been removed after its discovery. Rouletted decoration covers the upper part of the body. This is a common form of the later third and fourth centuries, and is either a product of the Oxfordshire kilns or a related regional group.<br />The Cae Bardd hoard is composed of 4,716 argentiferous bronze coins minted between AD 316 and 328. However, the two SOLI INVICTO COMITI pieces of 316 and 317, and the CLARITAS REIPVBLICAE of 317 are outliers, and the hoard in effect begins with the VICTORIAE LAETAE PRINC PERP issues of 318-9. The latest coins present are the PROVIDENTIAE AVGG, PROVIDENTIAE CAESS and SECVRITAS REIPVBLICE pieces of Trier with the mint-mark PTRE, dateable to AD 327-8.<br />A complete absence of specimens of GLORIA EXERCITVS, VRBS ROMA and CONSTANTINOPOLIS indicates that the hoard was deposited shortly before or very soon after the minting of these new issues commenced in AD 330.""<br />The 4716 coins included 4648 regular AE coins, and 68 irregular.

Green at Caister by Yarmouth, a large walled area at least 34 acres in extent was found. ""Inside the walls at its eastern end, close to the main north-south street, a large rectangular building of flint, 150 ft. by 30 ft., had been erected at the end of the second century; it had an open portico on the south side, wattle-and-daub internal walls, and a tiled roof resting on oak rafters. In the first half of the third century the size of the hall was nearly doubled by an extension to the north, and here too was a northward wing and a courtyard with a water tank in it. At the end of the third century the roof of the extension fell in, but was restored early in the next century. At the same time the south portico, now long out of use, was covered with clay to bring it to the same level as the internal floors, which were of clay and rushes on the east, opus signinum on the west. In the clay packing covering the portico foundations a small hoard of coins of AD 326-341, current in the Danubian-Balkan area, had been buried.""<br />JRS, XLII (1952), 96<br />B.W. Pearce listed the coins from the hoard, 24 small AE:<br />AE<br />Constantine I 9<br />Licinius II 1<br />Constantine II, Caes. 3<br />Constantius II, Caes. 2<br />Constantinopolis 1 Urbs Roma 2<br />Constans, Caes. 1<br />Constantius II, Aug. 3<br />Constans, Aug. 2<br /><br />24<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 1 stand.)<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 1 stand.)<br />""The most interesting point about the hoard is that none of the coins were minted west of Rome and only one, at Cyzicus, east of Constantinople. The latest are of the Aquileia mint. I suggest that the coins were never in general circulation in Britain, but were brought into this country as a group, possibly by a merchant of Aquileia or nearby who traded chiefly in the Balkan Peninsula.""<br />B.W. Pearce, in NC, 1953, 135f., types, mints<br />Letter, April 1988, from Miss M. Darling, stating that the hoard had been contained in a pot, of which she has a drawing. She provided the following description, and comments:<br />""The pot in which they [i.e. the coins] were found was a shell-tempered jar of the South Midlands family, broadly fourth century, but probably late in the century at Caister.<br />It was found in EIX grid associated with rubbish dumping on the rear of the rampart. The grid square is relevant as I strongly suspect there was much more post Roman disturbance in the area of EIX-X than Green recognised during excavation. This could well account for the fact that the pot was broken, and a few sherds dispersed into a different layer.<br />The small size of the hoard and the relatively large pot, plus the absence of any coins likely to have been part of the hoard in surrounding layers, suggest the hoard was complete."" "" ******* There may be some confusion about the container, about which it is noted: ""It was found in EIX grid associated with rubbish dumping on the rear of the rampart."" It is not mentioned in the JRS account.Mints listed but not all reverse types. Pearce's theory about a Danubian origin is derived from the fact that the most westerly mint is Aquileia although there does appear to be a mint of Arles listed (misattributed to Constantinople).","5/6/2021 11:06:11 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10490","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10490","11/23/2024"

Frere, M.A., F.S.A., were working on the clearance of a Roman building close to St. George's Street, which is marked as No. 6 in the Committee's appeal of May 1949. It was a bath-house, which showed evidence of use from the second to the fourth century AD In one room (No. 7), which was identified as an undressin-room, no less than 261 coins were found in about on-third of the room, i.e. the area where the stratification was undisturbed. Mr. Frere and the present writer are certain that these coins cannot at any time have been a hoard. They were found singly, not in lumps, in the crevices of and on the flagged floor of the room. A thick layer of debris, which was the result of the collapse of the building, lay upon the floor and so on the coins. This had not been disturbed since its fall, and it follows that the coins were found in the positions which they occupied when the building fell into ruin. The natural conclusion from this is that they were lost singly, presumably by patrons of the baths, whilst undressing in the room.<br />The 261 coins include 64 legitimate issues, 62 barbarous copies thereof of normal size, 33 similar barbarous copies, but of smaller size, usually called minimi, 60 small enough to be dubbed minimissimi, and 42 whole or fragmentary illegible coins of normal size..<br />The minimi are those which have a diameter of 5-6 mm. A few show traces of the legionary spearing fallen horseman type; none show any other type. A few have been roughly cut from larger coins, but most are on quite wel-made, circular flans. The minimissimi are smaller still, 3-4 mm. in diameter as a rule, but there is one of 2.5 mm., and even one of barely 1.5 mm. which is not a piece of another coin, but an entity in itself, and is the smallest thing of its kind which the present writer has ever seen. Of these, 12, including one of 3 mm. diameter, show traces of the legionary spearing fallen horseman type.<br />""<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil, in NC, 1948, 226-9, full discussion of coins<br />Cp. C.H.V. Sutherland, in NC, 1949, 242-4<br />S.S. Frere, and Sally Stow, in Arch. of Cant., VII (1983), 34f., gave a list of the coins, and added, of the room on whose tiled floor the coins were found: ""Perhaps it was the apodyterium, but this is unlikely because of its position. More likely it was a room where gambling took place, for these coins were scattered all over the surviving portion of the floor; they had not been concealed. They might, however, conceivably have formed part of a hoard concealed e.g. in the roof, which fell and scattered when the building caught fire.""<br />The 261 coins, all AE, were listed as follows:<br />AE<br />Constantinopolis 3<br />Urbs Roma 4<br />Helena (after AD 337) 1<br />Theodora (after AD 337) 2<br />Constantine II 2<br />Constantius II 7<br />Constans 12<br />Constantius II, or Constans, Aug. 19<br />House of Constantine I 10<br />Magnentius 1<br />Valens 1<br />Arcadius 1 irregular FEL TEMP REPARATIO, falling horseman 59<br />illegible 30<br />frags.

This theory of an early end to Period 2 seems more acceptable than one which, on the evidence of the coins, involves a period of disuse from c. 360 to 390, followed by re-use."""" ******* It is clear from the comments of Sutherland (1949, 242-4) that the 'minimissimi' here are Fel Temp copies and not Theodosian coins. He suggests that the coins of Arcadius and Valens could be intrusive and relate to a period of reuse of the site.

C.D. Crofts, owing to the grating of a plough against a large stone, some Roman remains deserving of notice have lately been brought to light. These consist of the base of a pillar formed of Ancaster stone, two feet in diameter below, and one foot five above (see woodcut), upon which was placed another circular stone corresponding with the one below, and having a perforation in its centre between three and four inches wide. This, on raising the upper stone, was found to contain a small olla of black earthenware filled with copper coins, about sixteen in number. The jar fell to pieces immediately on its exposure to the air, and most of the coins are illegible, but amongst them there is one large brass of Faustina, junior, reverse, Juno; one small brass of Constantius, another with Urbs Roma, reverse, the Wolf and Twins; a third brass of Magnentius; also coins in defaced condition, apparently of Gratianus and of Honorius or Arcadius.""<br />E. Trollope, in AJ, XIV (1857), 141-3, figs.<br />The woodcut, and the description show that the ""pillar"" was in fact a quern stone set on a base, with an upper quern stone fitted over it.

    1Coin data quality rating: Good (Grade 3)Description1 sestertius, 2 radiates and 131 nummi to 402. The coins are a mixed group but the majority (66 identifiable coins) are Valentinianic nummi and some later nummi dating up to AD 402. The group also included a worn sestertius of Antonine date, two radiates of Claudius II and a number of earlier nummi. The majority of coins were worn but the composition and spatial proximity of the group probably reflects that of a scattered late Roman hoard.

D.R. Williams-Hunt, of the 2nd Bn. Royal Fusiliers, has reported a Roman Site on Chilbolton Down, with signs of occupation from early days to mid-fourth century. It consists of a flat area or terrace on the side of the hill about 60ft. by 18ft. It lies 1 mile 3 furlongs S.W. of the Roman Road running N.W. from Winchester and half a mile S.E. of the straight piece of road running under Woolbury Camp from Stockbridge to Sutton Scotney.<br />The hoard of coins was found about the end of July 1941 by some Royal Artillery gunners in digging a trench, in what appeared to be the site of a rubbish pit with oxen bones, rough pottery shards and general rubbish. The two pottery vessels which contained the coins were shattered and unfortunately half of one disappeared into a sandbag and could not be traced. Fragments will probably be recovered when the sandbags rot. Coins in this vessel were rapidly dispersed amongst the soldiers and not many were recovered. The other vessel was recovered complete except for the handle, which seems to have been lost in ancient times, and one small chip in the shoulder.<br />The contents were about 900 coins, all in very fine condition, bronze or silver washed. Mr. Williams-Hunt had not the exact list when he wrote, but roughly puts the varieties as follows:<br />Constantine I 60 per cent.<br />Crispus 15 per cent.<br />Constantine II 25 per cent.<br />Helena 5 per cent.<br />Licinius 1 coin only<br />Fausta 5 per cent.<br />Mr. Williams-Hunt disclaims being a coin expert, but with one exception has seen all types before.<br />There is a grand array of different mint marks, but though he has noted these he cannot answer as to their rarity. One exceptional coin is a small bronze one. Obv., a laur. bust; rev., inscription only:-<br />*<br />CONSTANT<br />INUS<br />AUG<br />P.T.R.<br />Incidentally Mr. Williams-Hunt says he has included the common VRBS ROMA and Constantinopolis-types which are well represented under Constantine I in the above estimate.<br />He also sends a 'rather poor snap' he took of the flagons. He has repaired the smaller one, but the larger example is minus the neck, and adds that there are several fragments which do not join.<br />The coins and vessels are, I believe, in the possession of Mr. G.W. Beale, of Hill Farm, on which property the finds occurred.""<br />-Proc. Hants. Field Club, XV (1941-1943), 212<br />-The Winchester Museum acquired over 820 Constantinian coins, and the two pots which contained the coins. One pot has been a one-handled flagon of hard grey ware, smoothed on the surface, and with a scored pattern on the neck. The other pot was a large jar with the neck lost, of hard grey clay with very dark grey slip, and a band of diamond pattern on the shoulder.<br />Prof. M.

The hoard has now been dispersed, although the landowner kindly presented 446 pieces (including all the imitations) to the Verulamium Museum, St. Albans, and 244 to the British Museum.<br />The hoard was found with a pot, and I am grateful to Adrian Havercroft of the Verulamium Museum for providing the accompanying drawing and comments. In all nine pieces of pottery were recovered with the hoard. There is no reason to suggest that they belong to more than one vessel, indeed seven of them join to form a base (Fig. 110: 1). The remaining two sherds are considerably thinner in section and are from the upper wall of the vessel.<br />The ware is of medium hardness, with orange-surfaces and has an extremely coarse grey core. Throughout it is tempered with large, hard, light-dark grey grog, with occasional fine black inclusions and (?) flint. The surviving portion of the vessel is well made and indicates a flat base and marked internal rilling of the lower wall. In addition the internal surface is slightly vesiculated. In general terms however the base shows no signs of wear. The edges of several sherds indicate 'old breaks' and there is little doubt that the vessel was cracked 'in situ' prior to its discovery.""<br />A. Havercroft continued his comments by suggesting that the potsherds came from a large jar with a deep, out-turned undercut rim. He compared the form with similar potsherds from the Roman Theatre at Verulamium; Gadebridge; the kiln site at Radlett; and the Roman bath-house at Branch Road, St Albans (cp. Fig. 111: 2). ""It can therefore be said that whilst a mid-fourth century usage is proven, the ware may have a long life beginning certainly no later than the mid-Antonine period.""<br />A.M.

O'Neil for examination.<br />The pot is a small squat vessel, with everted rim and a well-marked neck; it measures 4 in. high, 3 1/2 in. rim diameter, increasing to 4 in. on the body; about a third of the rim is missing. It is made of coarse dark grey clay, containing a good deal of pounded shell as 'backing'. The surface is black, except the neck which is grey in irregular patches, due probably to bad stacking in the kiln. The body of the pot has been lightly combed (with ?twigs) when still damp and on the wheel.<br />The letter C has been incised and then pecked out on the shoulder..<br />The Corinium pot is dated by its contents to the very end of the Roman period.

On Saturday night a man who was employed in getting stone out of a quarry at Cleeve Prior, near Evesham, discovered two large earthen pots, which, on examination, he found contained a considerable quantity of coins. He was, of course, greatly overjoyed at the discovery, but having got possession of the idea that the Lord of the Manor would lay claim to the treasure, he refused to tell the quantity of pieces he had found; however, he has disposed of a few which are in the hands of gentlemen in Evesham and neighbourhood. They prove to be gold and silver coins of several Roman Emperors. The gold coins are of the Emperors Valerian [sic], one of the Valentinians, Gratian, and Theodosius. It is scarcely possible to imagine their excellent state of preservation; they appear as if they had just been issued from the mint, not the minutest mark being obliterated, though from 14 to 1500 years have elapsed since they were coined, and, what is very interesting to the antiquarian, counterfeits were discovered among them executed in a most excellent manner, being copper plated with gold. The silver coins are those of Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Gratian, and Theodosius; these were not in so good a state of preservation as the gold. The execution of these coins is, of course, not very good, the art of cutting the dies being at that period very much upon the decline. The man has acknowledged that he found 100 of the gold ones; the silver ones most probably greatly exceeded that number.""<br />Berrow's Worcester Journal, 31 Oct. 1811; copied in Cheltenham Chronicle, 7 Nov. 1811; abbreviated in Shrewsbury Chronicle, 8 Nov. 1811 copy supplied, 1979, by E.J.

They are of very pure gold, in the most perfect state of preservation, but amongst them are several of copper plated with gold. The silver coins are worn and appear to have been in circulation..<br />The pots stood upon stone of 8 inches in depth, in a stratum of clay of 18 inches: over the pots was placed stone of 4 inches in depth and above that, the natural soil 16 inches in depth from the surface.""<br />Then came a description of gold coins of Valentinian I (3); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); and Theodosius (1): silver coins of Constantius II (1); Julian (3); Valentinian I (2); Gratian (1); Valentinian II (1); Theodosius (2).<br />Gent.

Brandish, 4 June 1812, in Ms. Min. Soc. Ant., XXXIII (1811-17), 148, and E. Rudge, in Arch., XVII (1814), 329f., gave brief accounts, with types of 2 sil. of Gratian and Magnus Maximus.<br />Gent. Mag., 1814, I, 86, and G. May, Hist. of Evesham (1834), 244 n., gave very brief accounts, the latter, however, adding that the silver coins were ""of the reign of Constantine<br />"" [possibly of Constantius II].<br />BM Mss. Add. 33661, 27 Aug. 1815, also gave a brief account, but did mention 1 AV of Valentinian (I?), and 2 sil. of Gratian and Maximus.<br />Prattinton's Ms. Vol. VII (in Library of Soc. Ant., London) preserved several lists of small collections of coins from the Cleeve Prior hoard.<br />After referring to several of the previous accounts, J. Allies, The ancient British, Roman, Saxon Antiquities and folk-lore of Worcs.., 2 ed. (1852), 91-4, continued:<br />""Rev. R.D. Stillingfleet, Vicar of Cleeve Prior, in answer to some inquiries I made respecting the coins, stated that Thomas Sheppey, the man who found them in the first instance, conveyed them secretly to his own house; that he afterwards took them to the Dean and Chapter of Worcester, (Lords of the Manor), who, after reserving a few of the coins, returned him the remainder..<br />I have seen some of the coins in the possession of Rev. Allen Wheeler, of Worcester, and Rev. Wm. Brown, of Bredicot; in addition to some of the above [i.e. those described in earlier accounts] they have coins of Valerian, D.N.Fl. Victor and Gordianus Pius.<br />Sheppey stated that a goat's head was found in the excavation, which was perhaps a votive offering made upon depositing the coins.<br />After writing the above, I went to Cleeve Prior, and saw at the Rev. Mr. Stillingfleet's, in addition to those previously mentioned, a gold coin of Arcadius, and two silver coins, one of Vespasian, and another which I could not decipher. T. Sheppey, the finder of the urns and coins, informed me that the quantity of gold coins found in one of the urns (which would hold about two quarts) amounted to about six lbs. in weight; that there were about 3000 silver coins in the other urn, which would contain about a gallon; that the goat's head was found four or five yards from the urns, about four feet deep, in a cavity made in the quarry, which cavity was of the shape of a basin at the bottom; that he was offered Â£700 for the coins, which he refused; that he considered they were worth about Â£1000 but could not tell the total amount received for them, they having been sold in parcels at various times.<br /><br />the late Rev. Mr. Digby, Canon of Worcester Cathedral, informed me that one of the urns also contained gold coins of Valens, Magnus Maximus, and Arcadius, and he gave me an account of 255 of the gold coins and of 832 of the silver coins.""<br />F. Haverfield, in VCH Worcs., I (1901), 216f. (cp. VCH Worcs. 3 (1913), 308 n.2) observed:<br />""The gold coins included issues of Valentinian I and II, Valens, Gratian, Theodosius and Arcadius. The finder declared that in total they weighed 6 lb, and, if we assume they resembled the ordinary gold coins of the period, they must have numbered between 550 and 600 if the man reckoned by avoirdupois, as a labourer would probably do, or between 450 and 500 if he reckoned by the troy weight usually employed for precious metals. Canon Digby of Offenham gave Mr. Allies an account of 255 of these, but it has not survived. The gold coins are said to have been in singularly good preservation and for the most part to have consisted of very pure gold, but some were only plated copper. This last statement may however be an error, for the gold coinage of the 4th century was almost uniformly pure, and as its value depended largely on its weight, forgeries were necessarily difficult.<br />The silver coins of the hoard included issues of Constantius II, Julian, Valens, Valentinian I, Gratian, Magnus Maximus, Theodosius, and Honorius, with, according to Mr. Allies, one coin of Vespasian. They were stated by the finder to number about 3,000; of 832 Canon Digby gave Mr. Allies an account. The silver coins were, it is said, much more worn than the gold as indeed one might expect. Mr Allies and Mr. May add that the hoard also comprised coins of Gordian, Valerian, Constantine, Valens and Flavius Victor, but they do not mention the metals. Let me further point out that at the Worcestershire Exhibition of 1882 the late Canon A.H. Winnington Ingram, rector of Harvington near Cleeve Prior, exhibited coins from the hoard and an object described in the 'Catalogue' (p. 53) as 'a Roman lady's bronze chatelaine found at Cleeve Prior'. I do not know whether this has anything to do with the hoard nor can I discover what has become either of the coins or the 'chatelaine'.""<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil, in NC, 1936, 314-16, discussed the previous accounts, and also the information preserved in the Haverfield Mss. (now in the Haverfield Library, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The presence of coin(s) of Honorius in the hoard is established by a letter from G.L. Eades, 10 May 1901, to Haverfield.<br />The most engaging account of the discovery is in E.A.B. Barnard, Evesham and Four Shires Notes and Queries, II, 1911-14, 219-21.<br />7 sil. from the Cleeve Prior hoard were in the Caerleon Museum (now in NMW, Cardiff) They were said to be of Constantius II (1); Magnentius [sic] (1 VIRTVS ROMANORVM TRPS); Julian II (1); Valentinian II (2), Magnus Maximus (1); Flavius Victor (1). (J. Lee, Isca Silurum (1862), 81f.)<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil gave a minimum list of coins recorded in the various early accounts (omitting, however, Arcadius): AV AR TOTAL<br />Constantius II 10 10<br />Julian II 12 12<br />Valentinian I 2 7 9<br />Valens 15 15<br />Gratian 1 11 12<br />Valentinian II 1 5 6<br />Theodosius 1 6 7<br />Magnus Maximus 12 12<br />Flavius Victor 1 1<br />Honorius 1 1<br /><br />5 80 85<br />Other emperors mentioned in connection with the hoard (Vespasian, Gordian III, Valerian and Constantine, the last probably a mistake for Constantius II) must either have been wrongly identified, or have been intruders from other source.<br />Cathy E.

The hoard rested in loose earth, at a depth of two feet nine inches below the present surface, and six inches below the upper street level, of which the cobbled pavement breaks away before reaching the wall. It formed a solid mass of metal. The coins composing it were welded together, and many of them had been burned to a brick-red, showing that the whole had been subjected to intense heat; and, as small pieces of charcoal were found embedded in the mass, it is not improbable that a bag or wooden box containing the coins had fallen among burning timbers.<br />Under the circumstances it is not possible to describe the hoard in detail, or even to give with accuracy the total number of coins that it contained.

The hoard was in an exposed section of a machine-dug trench. It appeared to lie in a shallow depression, c. 20cm deep and c. 20cm in diameter, overlying a dark grey sandy silt which may have been a Roman foreshore deposit. It was sealed by a layer of grey clay which represented post-Roman (possibly Mediaeval) flooding.<br />The find-spot is some 250m. east of London Bridge and c. 45m south of the modern river wall. It is some 150m east of the higher ground which formed the main Roman settlement of Southwark, and is in an area which was mainly covered by creeks and marshes during much of the Roman period. However, the depth at which the coins were found, 1.20m above ordnance datum, suggests, on the basis of evidence elsewhere in Southwark, that the findspot was dry ground during at least a part of the Roman period. In addition, it was found approximately 20m west of a stone building (excavated in 1983) which was constructed, probably, during a later recession of the Roman river, and which confirms Roman activity nearby.<br />The circumstances of discovery did not allow the hoard to be related stratigraphically to the building. Neither was it clear whether the coins were deliberately concealed in a hole, or merely dropped either on a land surface or even into mud or water. No trace of a container was noted, and the coins were loosely scattered within the depression in which they were found. Since the hoard came from the edge of a machine-dug trench, some coins may have been lost when the trench was dug. However, the size and shape of the depression suggests that at least half of the hoard was probably recovered..<br />The latest coin in the hoard dated to 378-83. However, of the 36 Valentinianic coins identified, 21 (including most of the latest coins in the hoard) were in a state of wear which suggested that they had been in circulation for some period, while a further eleven were somewhat more heavily worn. Only three showed slight wear. It seems possible, therefore, that the coins may have been lost during the early years of the 380s, though the absence of Theodosian issues presumably indicated that the date of loss was not long after it.""<br />The 44 AE coins were catalogued according to types and mints.<br />M.

A boy thrust his hand into the jar and found a great number of what he thought to be gun wads. On the arrival of some of the men the wads were thought to be spade guineas. A general scramble ensued, some filling their caps, others their dinner bags. On examination it was found that the jar was a beautiful Roman one, in a state of good preservation, and that it contained 6 stones, or 84 lbs. avoirdupois of Roman coins, some of them well preserved, and judging from their design, make, and finish of a high antiquity.<br />Under what circumstances this wonderful great treasure was deposited it is difficult to conjecture."" Some of the coins were of Constantius and Magnetius [sic].<br />Malton Messenger, 23 Oct. 1858; transcript supplied, Jan. 1953, by Malton Gazette, formerly Malton Messenger, through Miss Ivy Hill, Castleford Library and Museum, and Miss Amy G. Foster, Librarian and Archivist, Yorks. Arch. Soc.<br />At a meeting of the East Riding Antiquarian Society at Driffield, on 4 April 1905, the Rev. E. Maule Cole gave a paper on Roman coins found in the wolds. After dealing with the find at Nunburnholme in 1855, he continued:<br />""Another famous 'find' was that at Cowlam in 1859 [sic], where an immense vase was unearthed by lads at the plough, who filled their pockets with the coins, abandoned their work, and said that they meant to live like gentlemen. In proof of this, Mr. Cole had secured the presence of an old man named Hotham, who was acting as foreman on the Cowlam farm, and was ploughing when the treasure was turned up. Hotham, a veteran of seventy-eight years, hale and hearty, and evidently delighted to be present, stood up, and in reply to Mr. Cole, said there were twelve lads present. 'They all wanted some in their pockets' he added, 'and I took all I could get hold of for my master. It was about half past three in the afternoon, and you should have seen the lads reaching ower the pankin and scramping the money in'. Mr. Cole: 'They meant for the future to live as gentlemen?' Hotham: 'Ay, that they did. They said, ""We'll nivver wark na mair! (Laughter) and they brak off a lump of the pankin in getting it up'. Mr. Cole (proceeding) said the lads had to hand over their spoil, and 10,256 coins were sent to a dealer in London. From him Mr. Christopher Sykes purchased 100 for Mr. Mortimer, and they were in his museum. None were purchased by the British Museum, though some might have found their way since then into the national collection.""<br />F. Haverfield, in Antiquary, XLI (1905), 196; cp. Rev. E.

Whelan, the dealer, gave a list of 9256 coins from this hoard, which were left in his possession after Mr. C. Sykes had bought 100 for J.R. Mortimer. Rev. E.

A man named William Currell was engaged in the search for water, and his spade struck upon a pewter or white metal vessel, not more than five or six inches below the surface, which had already been broken into several pieces. It was, however, dug out from the ground, and was found to contain no less than 1496 silver coins, some cast silver ingots that had been cut into strips, and a silver ring set with an intaglio. The vessel has, so far as possible, been restored to its original form.<br />It may be described as bottle-shaped. In height it is about 9 1/4 inches, and 7 inches in greatest diameter, the base being 4 inches across. Since the woodcut was made, the neck of the vessel, about 1 1/2 inches in length, has been found by Mrs. Kettlewell. It is about 1 1/4 inches inside diameter, and shows traces of there having been a handle to the vessel..<br />The silver ring, of which also a woodcut is given, is of a not uncommon character, with the gem - a carnelian - projecting a considerable distance beyond the socket in which it is mounted. It presents the flattened oval opening for the finger so common in Roman rings. The gem has a figure of Mars bearing a trophy and spear engraved in intaglio upon it..<br />The pieces of cast silver are five in number, not counting a small fragment, which has probably been broken off from one of them. One is a small lenticular cake about 1 1/4 inch in diameter, which seems to have been run into a depression in clay or sand. It has an indentation from a chisel on its upper surface. Its weight is 516 grains.<br />Two of the other pieces are portions of another and large flat cake of silver about 2 1/2 inches in diameter, which has been cut into three by means of two parallel cuts with a chisel. Only the middle strip, which is about 5/8 inch wide, was present, and one of the outside segments. These weigh 248 and 806 grains respectively.<br />The other two pieces are segments of cakes of the same character; one of them about 2 1/2 inches long and 1 inch broad in the middle, weighs 818 grains; the other 2 1/4 inches long and 3/4 inch in extreme breadth, weighs 644 grains.

The bulk of the hoard is fused in a lump which may have assumed the shape of a purse in which the coins were originally concealed. At the time of discovery, there was reported to be a layer of darkish earth which might have been the remains of decayed leather. The weight of this lump is 1,150gm, which would suggest that it consists of approximately 600 coins. In addition, 62 coins have become separated from the lump at some stage; some of these are now single, and some remain in small (2-13 coins) fused groups. This might suggest that the size of the hoard is closer to 700, although the weight of corrosion products needs to be taken into account. All the coins that can be identified or part-identified appear to be Constantinian issues of the period, c. AD 320-340; whilst some are quite badly corroded, many seem to have been relatively fresh when deposited.

Thirty-four of the coins are of Constantinian type, including a few silver ones. All the rest are barbarous copies of Roman coins. There are 209 which have been separated and also an unknown number in a solid clay-and-coin clod not separated at the time of writing. They have been taken to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, for positive identification.<br />The discovery, probably the biggest of its kind ever made in this district, was made by Mr. R.W. Griffiths, of 69 Napier Street, Bletchley, during the course of the Society's methodical excavation of the site. They were found in a cluster in the earth itself at a depth of 4 ft. 1 in. The only other article found in the same spot was a barbed arrowhead made of iron. It was found at the same time.""<br />N. Bucks. Times, 19 July 1962; SCMB, Oct. 1962<br />""On 9 July 1962 a hoard of fourth century coins was found during excavations in a fourth century building site which ran along and to the South of Watling Street adjacent to Magiovinium. The coins were probably originally contained in a bag as a metal clasp was found in conjunction with them. At the time of discovery the excavator (R.W. Griffiths) stated there were approximately 251 loose coins and a conglomerate of perhaps 400 more. The hoard was sent to the Ashmolean Museum for examination where an attempt was also made to separate the centrally corroded mass into its individual elements but without much success and a significant number of coins remained fused together. A summary report of the hoard's contents was sent to the excavators and the coins were lodged in the Buckinghamshire County Museum in Aylesbury where they remain today.<br />In 1984 the coins were again brought to the Ashmolean Museum for examination. At that time 306 pieces could be isolated and listed. The general condition of the coins was very poor - many were totally illegible and a significant number partially so. In the initial report on the hoard it was suggested that the coins may have been originally fused together as a result of fire which also caused the cup-shape form of some pieces, and the fact that in some cases the side of the coins seems almost to have melted away..<br />The interest of this hoard lies in the fact that it is composed almost entirely of ancient copies to which a few of the very common coins of 330 to 348 were added. There are no coins of Magnentius and Decentius nor are there any of the early post-reform FEL TEMP REPARATIO pieces of larger module and higher silver contents. This hoard consists of pieces of the lowest possible value and thus either the better quality pieces have been excluded or never came into the possession of the hoarder. The high percentage of Fel Temp copies to the exclusion of almost everything else is also unusual..<br />It seems unlikely that the hoard would have been buried before 354 to 355.""<br />Cathy E.

He was soon on the spot, and leaving most of those in the water where they had fallen, he gathered from the hole as many more as he could well carry. The villagers of Filton, who saw him, say he had a hundredweight. He himself acknowledges to having upwards of three hundred pieces.<br />He brought me two hundred as a sample; these were all oxidised, some of them very much so indeed, others were in beautiful condition. They are second and third brasses of great variety of type, most of them of the coinage of London and Treves. Amongst those which I examined there were none earlier than Licinius, or later than Constans I. Those of Constantine the Great were by far the largest number. It is evident that they have never been in circulation, those unaffected by the atmosphere being as sharp as though just brought from the Mint.<br />In addition to these, the finder informs me that there were a vast number of smaller coins, measuring from the one-eighth to three-eighths of an inch, of which he had none with him, not thinking them of any value; of these he declared there were many thousands.<br />Having shown him some which I procured a few years since from a hoard discovered at Filwood [i.e. the Whitchurch, 1869, Somerset hoard, no. 808] he recognised them instantly<br />they run very irregular in size and shape, but have the greater portion a crowned head on the obverse - it is in every case in these lesser coins a spiked or rayed crown, which is, I think, a symbol of a British emperor. I have long thought that these are specimens of emergency money of the British usurpers. The other coins from Filton have either the wreathed coronet or the helmeted head upon the obverse. I found both Licinius senior and junior, Crispus, Constantine II., and Constans, as well as the better-known Constantine the Great. The pot in which they were contained was broken, and many had previously been swept away in times of flood. It was of common ware, about three-eighths of an inch thick.<br />Since the visit of the finder to myself, I have had a great number brought to me by other parties; a farmer from the village brought me for inspection a number, which have since been picked up in the brook. He says, scores of villagers were there on Sunday, wading in the muddy stream, and all of them were successful in their groping. He estimates many hundreds as the produce of that kind of work on that day.""<br />-J.F. Nicholls, in PSA, (2), VIII (1879-81), 385-8<br />""The only coin in the hoard of any rarity, but in poor preservation, is the same as that described in Akerman's Catalogue, vol. ii, p. 246, - 'Obverse, a laureated head with cornucopia on the shoulder; inscription, POP. ROMANVS. Reverse, a bridge with towers at each end. In the field, CONS E. It is of the size of a quinarius.'

He and another man who was working with him saw two youths throwing stones at a jar half concealed in the bank of the stream presumably to see who could break it first. They succeeded, and Mr. Jones' uncle saw the coins coming out of the broken jar and went with his friend to get them out of the stream before they became embedded too deeply in the soft soil of the bank. Apparently he did not notify any authority of the find but rather kept them as an interesting curiosity, and eventually after his death they were passed on to his nephew.""<br />The coins were all AE:<br />AE<br />Constantine I 2<br />Crispus 1<br />Constantine II, Caes. 2<br />Constantius II, Caes. 4<br />Constantinopolis 5<br />Urbs Roma 2<br />House of Constantine I 1<br /><br />17<br />(GLORIA EXERCITVS, 1 stand., b.)<br />In spite of an apparent discrepancy in the date of discovery, it seems possible that these 17 coins came from the hoard found in 1880."" ******* The original find is thought to have been about 300 ?

Thornber.""<br />(Footnote: ""The remaining portion of these coins was purchased at the sale of the effects of Sir Hesketh Fleetwood, bart., at Rossall Hall, by Mr. Alderman Brown, of Preston, of whose collection they at present form the chief feature."")<br />-C. Hardwick, Hist. of Preston (1857), 23.<br />The Rev. W. Thornber himself stated that ""in the Fleetwood set of coins also Vespasians were not uncommon"" (Trans. Lancs. and Chesh. Ant. Soc., VI (1887), 108).<br />W.T. Watkin, Roman Lancashire (1886), 238, followed Hardwick's account, but in a further note in Trans. Lancs. and Chesh. Hist. Soc., XXXIX (1887), 49, added:<br />""I found out immediately before the publication of my book [i.e. Roman Lancashire] that the hoard owned by Alderman Brown was still in the possession of his son, Dr. Brown, but it was too late to give any particulars. After the issue of the work, however, Dr. Brown presented the coins (401 in number) to the Museum at Preston, but very singularly they turn out to be a hoard of an entirely different date, ranging from AD 353 to AD 408, and are of the following emperors."" Then came a list of emperors from Constantius II to Honorius.<br />""Can this be the hoard described by Mr. Hardwick?<br />If not there can be but one alternative, i.e. that two hoards were found at the same place, one of the Higher, the other of the Lower Empire; unless the hoard presented to the Preston Museum came from some other part of the country.""<br />The apparently dual nature of the ""Fleetwood"" hoard has been discussed more recently in NC, 1948, 205-14, where the dilemma is clearly stated: ""In support of the view that there were two separate hoards, it may be said that a hoard of fourth-century siliquae could never have been mistaken for a hoard of first- to third-century denarii..<br />In support of the view that only one hoard of Roman silver coins was found at Fleetwood, it may be said that it is most unlikely that two hoards, one of denarii, and the other of siliquae, should be found at the same place, apparently at about the same time, and containing about the same number of coins, namely, about four hundred, while it is even more unlikely that a hoard of 400 denarii, said to be the 'chief feature' of Alderman Brown's collection, should have disappeared without leaving any trace, while its place was taken by a hoard of 400 siliquae, unaccompanied by any account of its discovery.""<br />There were, in 1948, only 388 sil., in Harris Museum, Preston (see no. 1553).<br />-Anne S. Robertson, in NC, 1948, 205-14, types, mints of 388 sil."" ******* EG comments: Robertson considers the two accounts to refer to the same hoard. However, whilst people do sometimes mistake siliqua hoards for denarius hoards in casual references, there are enough details here to suggest that the denarius hoard did exist. Possibly there is some confusion in the part of the earlier author in connecting it with that owner? Shotter's view (1990, 154) is that it is likely that the original provenance of the siliquae became confused as they passed through two private collections (Sir Hesketh Fleetwood and Alderman Brown) and that there were therefore two hoards. Matthew Ball of the Harris Museum, Preston is currently researching the hoard. The record here is for the extant siliqua hoard only (following Robertson in combining these entries and King for the catalogue) and not the denarius hoard to AD 211-7. The coins show a high degree of clipping.A siliqua hoard is described in the Palatine Notebook III 1883 p. 171 but the reference was not available to be checked.","5/6/2021 11:05:54 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10404","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10404","11/23/2024"

However the latter coins were picked out due to their being rare in the hoard and the letter quoted in Symons (1990, 132) suggests that the coins were in fact similar in each pot.

Some Roman sherds and two 4th-century coins - of the same class as those in the hoard itself - proved this gulley to be of Roman date.<br />It is clear, therefore, that the 7th-century grave-diggers happened accidentally to choose a part of the Iron Age site which had already been disturbed at the end of the Roman period and used for the concealment of a coin-hoard. Their grave was cut diagonally across the Roman gully and the coin hoard was scattered, some at least of the coins finding their way into the filling of the grave. Whether the majority of the coins had been retained by their finders, and whether the remaining 50 had been intentionally thrown back into the grave, it is difficult to say, but two points may be mentioned. First, seven coins including two not belonging to the hoard, were found in such close juxtaposition to the skeleton as to suggest that they had been deliberately placed on the corpse. Second, the coins found among the stones placed at the top of the grave were so close together and conspicuous that, in normal circumstances, they could hardly have been missed. On the whole one is tempted to conclude that the Anglo-Saxons who dug the grave found a large hoard, and left a small residue as an offering to their dead kinsman, whose obsequies had led to the unexpected discovery.""<br />The coins were all small AE:<br />AE<br />Constantine I 1<br />Constantine II, or Constantius II, Caes. 1<br />Constantinopolis 1<br />Constantius II, Aug. 2<br />Contans, Aug. 7<br />Constantius II, or Constans, Aug. 6<br />Magnentius 2<br />Valentinian I 6<br />Valens 20<br />Valentinian I or Valens 1<br />Gratian 2<br /><br />49<br />(semi-b.

The first coin (no. 2) was discovered by Mr Cuddeford in February 1992 and Mr Cuddeford found a further 5 coins while searching on the same field in 1993. The coins were found scattered over an area some 70 metres square; no trace of a container was found. They were declared Treasure Trove at an inquest held on 19 May 1993, and were subsequently acquired by Chelmsford Museum Service.' R Bland, CHRB X, p. 482. `Addenda of six gold solidi were recovered from the site of the Good Easter hoard by Mr M. J. Cuddeford while searching with a metal detector in 1998. A further two solidi were found in September 2001, October 2002 and August 2003. This brings the total to 16 solidi, including one plated imitation in the original find. The Lyon solidus of Constantine III (RIC X: 1505) is a particularly noteworthy find, slightly amending the closing date (the four G's in the reverse legend indicates striking prior to the death of Arcadius in 408), and considerably increasing the importance of the hoard. No gold of Constantine III occurred in the Hoxne hoard; the Anne Robertson Inventory lists only two British hoards, Stanmore and Eye (RBCH 1619 &amp; 20), both found in 1781 and long dispersed, but which were said to have each contained at least one example. On the continent, the most prolific find of Constantine III gold comes from a hoard of 188 solidi found in 1754 at Menzelen, Germany which apparently included at least 33 examples. The finder generously waived his share of the reward and the coins have been acquired by Chelmsford Museum Service.' Report by Richard Abdy.

Pearce writes:-<br />'So little can be seen on the coins that it is not possible to say that they were in use at any particular time other than after AD 350-3 (Magnentius).<br />It is likely that most of these coins were cut from coins of larger flan.<br />There is no specific evidence, other than size, that the hoard belongs to the fifth century, and evidence seems to be accumulating that the reason for the small size is more likely small value than the diminution of the flan due to scarcity of metal.'""<br />The Roman Town and Villa at Great Casterton, ed.

    1Coin data quality rating: Excellent (Grade 4)Description9 miliarenses and 653 siliquae to Honorius in a pot (not connected with denarius hoard from same parish). NC 2011.Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2010 T177Other PAS records associated with this hoard: DOR-A1CCB1NotesOne siliqua in BM, 33 in Fitzwilliam (and pot). Interested Museums were unable to acquired and the hoard was sold at auction by Spink. The portion in the Fitzwilliam was the Gift of Richard Beleson and the San Fransisco Ancient Numismatics Society in honor of Ted Buttrey. (EG): About 75% of the coins in the hoard were clipped, with 42% only lightly clipped (""clipping factor 1""). Generally, clipping was spread throughout the hoard, indicating that the coins were circulating together at the time of burial. Somewhat higher proportions of the coins from the period 367 to 378 are unclipped than in earlier and later periods. No coins were found to be heavily clipped, although the edges of some of the later coins were sometimes poorly preserved. The hoard contained 16 obviously irregular coins. During conservation some coins were identified as silver plated and others were thought to show the effects of surface enrichment due to chemical removal of the baser metal to improve the silvery appearance of the coin . This was difficult to distinguish visually from the effects of silver corrosion and analysis would be required to confirm this theory. Coins thought to be plated during conservation that appeared regular in type were included in the main catalogue and marked as possibly plated in the footnotes. Generally, the degree of preservation was very good, due to the conditions of burial. Removal of the coins from the pot was carried out in layers but there was no obvious stratification apart from the fact that the miliarenses were found at the top, in the neck of the pot. Although merely speculation, this fact could support a votive function for the hoard, with the offering intended to appear more generous than it was. Alternatively, this could have been due to the practicalities of packing a large number of coins into a small vessel (though they would have fitted through the neck of the vessel without difficulty). The hoard contained a few unusual coins. A siliqua of Valentinian II minted in Siscia (no. 103) has a previously unknown reverse type of a chi-rho within a wreath without additional legend. The mintmark SISCP suggests that it fits into the issue of that mint dated between AD 375 and 378. A siliqua of Valentinian II minted in Trier (no. 83) is a variant of Hoxne 327 and RIC IX 43/57a, with the mintmark TRP. This may be an engraver's error; another coin with the same reverse die is in the BM (1954,0508.7). One coin (no. 27) appears to have been deliberately scratched in a cross-hatched pattern on the obverse.Subsequent actions

Note that the dating of the brooch below is far removed from the coins.","5/6/2021 11:06:44 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10655","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10655","11/23/2024"

Before the construction work the site had been park land but displayed the ridge and furrow of earlier ploughing, and 18 inches of plough soil containing bone, brick, and oyster shell overlay the place where the pot was found. Below the plough soil was natural clay into which the pot had been set, but the high water table made it impossible to examine the clay immediately around the pot. The bottom of the pot was approximately 3 feet below the present surface, which roots of turf still showing in the mud proved at this point to have been as yet unaltered by levelling operations. The pot was removed by workmen but they were able to point out the exact spot, and the shape of the pot base could still be felt in the clay under the water..<br />The jar containing the hoard had evidently been broken up by ploughing but enough pieces remained to provide a complete section of the pot (Fig. 1, drawing by L.J. Keen). The fabric is a hard grey; dark grey externally and the core light grey. The rim is simply outcurved and with the neck burnished. Immediately below the neck and between the two deeply sunk handles is an unburnished zone scored with single loops. Below a burnished zone is another unburnished, scored with vertical lines. The rest of the pot, to the flat base, is smoothed..<br />Apart from two third-century Antoniniani of Tetricus I and Tacitus and some 200 small bronzes of the Constantinian dynasty between 317 and 348 the hoard was composed of the type of bronze coinage first introduced by Constantius II and Constans in 348 or by Magnentius and Decentius between 350 and 353.

Some boys, playing about the streamlet which rises on the north side of the meadow found in its bed a small vase and thirty or forty coins lying in the gravel. The news quickly spread among the peasantry, who, in expectation of finding a mine of wealth, lost no time in exploring the bed of the stream and thus eventually some hundred and forty coins and seven perfect vases, the produce of these unlicensed explorations, were recovered by the agent of the Earl of Shaftesbury, the lord of the manor; and under this gentleman's directions, a further search was made, which resulted in the discovery of a few coins; a large quantity of the debris of the same kind of pottery as the vases; an iron lance, or spear-head, three inches in length and one inch and three-quarters broad, with the socket and point eaten away by rust; a disc of bronze three inches and three-eighths in diameter; a few short pieces of thin tubular bronze of the size of a tobacco pipe, two or three of them having a rude linear ornamentation; some animal bones, horses' teeth; a few flint flakes; and one red amber bead.<br />""<br />The seven complete pots were all small, the largest being only 4 1/2 in. high.

The finder, Eric Lawes, located the treasure on November 16, 1992, and together with the tenant farmer of the land, Peter Whatling, immediately reported the discovery to Suffolk County Council, the landowners. This prompt action enabled a team from the Suffolk Archaeological Unit, under the direction of Judith Plouviez, to carry out a controlled emergency excavation of the remainder of the deposit on November 17. This was completed on the same day, and the finds were collected and taken to the British Museum on the following day. The deposit was lifted in small context blocks, and the recording and detailed excavation was therefore completed under laboratory conditions in the Museum. The hoard was declared Treasure Trove at a Coroner's Inquest in Lowestoft on September 3, 1993. Because of the timely reporting of the find and the consequent immediate involvement of professional archaeologists, the hoard is effectively complete (a few coins may have been scattered in previous ploughing), and details of the manner in which the objects were packed and buried were observed and noted. Some of the more fragile silver items would have been unlikely to survive amateur excavation..<br />Britannia 1994, 165<br />Container<br />""The extent of the deposit and the presence of corroded iron fittings indicate that the valuables were packed inside a wooden box measuring some 60 x 45 x 30 cm. Small box-fittings in silver, namely two padlocks, a hinge, several angle-brackets and decorative rosette-shaped studs, plus about 150 pieces of bone inlay, all testify to the presence of smaller caskets within the outer chest. There are fragments from a carved pyxis of bone or ivory, and minute fragments of woven textile have also been preserved. A carefully packed and stacked set of five plain silver bowls bore traces not only of cloth but also of organic padding between the vessels, probably hay..<br />Britannia 1994, 165<br />Names<br />""Seven personal names appear on objects in the treasure, one of them ... on the bracelet belonging to Juliana. The name Aurelius Ursicinus is found no fewer than ten times, engraved and picked out in black niello on a matching set of ten spoons, five ligulae and five cochlearia. Several men named Ursicinus are known from historical sources, but it is not possible to say whether one of them is identical with the Ursicinus of the Hoxne treasure... In any event, the presence of a whole set of spoons belonging to this one named individual raises a strong possibility that the whole hoard may have belonged to him. Other names include Peregrinus, Faustinus and a woman's name, Silvicola, all on spoons..<br />Contents (a) Other objects<br />""These consist chiefly of gold jewellery and silver plate, tableware and toilet implements. Apart from the coins, the two principal classes of material in the Hoxne hoard consist of gold jewellery and small items of silver tableware such as spoons. There are twenty-nine pieces of jewellery in all, comprising six necklaces, three finger-rings, one elaborate chain ornament, and nineteen bracelets... Silver plate, namely eating and drinking utensils made of silver, was owned by most wealthy Roman families, and could include large and highly decorated dishes, salvers, bowls and jugs as well as small containers, spoons and ladles. The Hoxne treasure was buried in a wooden box which was too small to contain vessels like the Great Dish from the Mildenhall Treasure, with its diameter of nearly 60 cm. Instead, the Hoxne tableware comprises seventy-eight spoons - nearly doubling the total number of late-Roman silver spoons known from Britain - twenty ladles and a variety of other small items including personal toilet implements such as toothpicks and ear-cleaners..<br />R. Bland and C. Johns, The Hoxne Treasure, (1993), 19, 25<br />The objects may be summarised as follows:<br />Gold<br />1-10 Necklaces and rings<br />11-29 Bracelets<br />Silver<br />30-41 Vessels: tiger handle, vases, piperatoria, bowls<br />42-61 Ladles<br />62-140 Spoons (ligulae, cochlearia, transverse ligulae)<br />141-144 Strainer-funnel and strainers<br />145-153 Toilet utensils (toothpicks, ear-scoops etc.)<br />154-169 Box-fittings (locks, mounts/brackets, hinge)<br />170-184 Miscellaneous: (rosette studs, mount, hemispheres)<br />Organic (ivory/bone/wood)<br />185-340 Decorated ?ivory box, bone inlay pieces, wooden fittings<br />Miscellaneous<br />341-388 Iron nails and bindings<br />389-391 Wood/metal fragments (?from large chest)<br />392 Textile fragments<br />393-399 Late additions<br />Miscellaneous fragments, modern objects, sherds (?Medieval)<br />Organic samples<br />Contents (b) Coins<br />""In all, some 14,941 coins have been recovered of which 577 are gold, 14,340 silver and 24 bronze [the initial discovery of the bulk of the hoard was supplemented by subsequent discoveries of 11 solidi and 81 reduced siliquae in October 1993 and of 68 reduced siliquae in September 1994]. The gold coins are all solidi ... and they all post-date Valentinian I's reform of AD 365-8, most of them being made during the reigns of Arcadius and Honorius, between c. AD 394 and c. 405. These coins are in an excellent state of preservation and, because none of them was more than about fifty years old at the time when the hoard is likely to have been buried, they have seen very little wear. The base metal coins include twenty-four small bronze coins of the fourth century AD, but unfortunately most of them are so poorly preserved that precise identification is impossible..<br />""The great bulk of the coins are therefore made of silver. Most notably, there are sixty light miliarenses, which weigh around 4.2 grams. The Hoxne specimens include as many as five unpublished varieties. The oldest coin in the hoard is a very worn miliarensis of Constantine II (AD 337-40). Most of the silver coins, however, are siliquae: apart from two coins made before this denomination was reduced in weight in c. AD 358, the remaining 14,205 specimens are all made on the reduced standard of around two grams. Finally there are also four half-siliquae of Arcadius and Honorius and one anonymous half-siliqua. Apart from the one specimen of Constantine II, all the silver coins were minted within a period of fifty years, between c. AD 358 and 408..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 165-6<br />""The find-spot is some four miles from the location where the Eye hoard of 650 gold coins of the same period was said to have been discovered in 1780 see no. 000). ""It remains a considerable coincidence that two finds containing over 500 solidi of the same period should have been made so close to each other and it seems at least possible that they might form two parts of the same deposit..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 166<br />""The terminus post quem for the Hoxne hoard is fixed by the presence of two siliquae of the usurper Constantine III (AD 407-11) which may be dated to AD 407-8. However, the hoard's likely terminus ante quem is more difficult to establish ....This therefore leads to the controversial problem of clipping, and when exactly it occurred. Some 80 per cent of the siliquae in the Hoxne hoard are clipped around the edge, as are, unusually, 4 of the 60 miliarenses; a high proportion of clipped coins in a hoard is generally taken to indicate its late date....To sum up, therefore, I think it possible that such coins as the siliquae in the Hoxne hoard could have continued to circulate in Britain, in an ever deteriorating condition, for up to 20 or 30 years after Constantine III's death, maybe as late as the 440s, but this cannot be proven. The best terminus ante quem that the hoard can be given is between 407 and c. 450..<br />Britannia 25, 1994, 168<br /><br />1.

As part of this search the whole area was investigated using a metal detector and readings plotted. The group of coins detailed below were found as a result of this search.

Rober Gwilt, the Lord of the Manor, who kindly placed them in my hands for examination. The precise number found is variously estimated, but it probably did not exceed four hundred.<br />The coins are all of silver, denarii and quinarii of the emperors of the latter part of the last century of the Roman rule in Britain. The majority are in a good state of preservation, and the metal untarnished; in several instances the coins are as brilliant as when first issued from the mint.<br />Of the vessel that contained them, the only portions recovered were the base, with its narrow foot and half the neck, representing a jar of about half a pint in capacity. It had evidently been broken some time previous to its final discovery; and fragments of it had, no doubt, been carried away in former ploughings, without materially disturbing the contents.<br />A visit to the spot, and a careful examination of the soil in the vicinity, resulted in the finding of four other coins, but no further fragments of the crock. The ground around however contained many small shards of different descriptions of pottery, from which I infer that the rising ground hereabouts was the site of dwelling-places during the Roman occupation; and that, beneath the floor of some hut or temporary dwelling, the small hoard was buried in some season of alarm, or for better safety during its owner's absence from home..<br />The coin of Valens, having the letters SPAK in the exergue, is of very rude workmanship, and the letters are upside down, closely following the reverse legend.<br />The proportion of denarii to quinarii is not easy to determine with any exactness, on account of the varying sizes and weights of the coins, and I do not attempt to distinguish them in the list. I may add, however, that the smaller coins would be, in proportion, about one fourth.""<br />Then came a list of 349 coins. ""The majority of the coins of Honorius are badly struck.""<br />H. Prigg, in Proc. Suff. Inst.

(cp. E.g. S.E. West, with Judith Plouviez, in East Anglian Arch., 3 (1976), 64).<br />In 1907, (Sir) George Hill examined 318 coins from this hoard:<br />""The silver coins described below were part of a miscellaneous collection shown to me in May, 1907. They came from a hoard which was dug up at Icklingham, in Suffolk, many years ago. With them was a list giving the numbers of the coins of each emperor as follows:"" Then came a list of 337 coins.<br />""As appears from the list which I give, 19 of the original number are missing, among them the coin of Constantius II. My classification of the Emperors, even allowing for the loss of 19 coins, differs considerably from that made by the original owner"". Then came (Sir) George Hill's list of 318 coins.<br />""The condition of the coins is not quite so good as that of the coins from Groveley Wood [no. 1597/8]<br />and many of them seem to have been clipped.""<br />(Sir) George Hill, in NC, 1908, 215-21, types, mints<br />The three lists, of 349, 337, and 318 coins, are:<br />All sil.?<br />Constantius II 1 1<br />Julian II, Aug. 19 11 19<br />Jovian 1 1 1<br />Valentinian I 28 26 6<br />Valens 73 72 72<br />Gratian 41 39 39<br />Valentinian II 9 9 29<br />Theodosius 43 53 40<br />Magnus Maximus 48 46 47<br />Flavius Victor 2 1 1 Eugenius 11 10 13<br />Arcadius 51 47 40<br />Honorius 22 21 11<br /><br />349 337 318<br />(1 b.)<br />It is evident, from the list of 318 coins given by (Sir) George Hill, that the two other lists have erred in assigning too many coins of Valentinian II to Valentinian I.<br />S.E. West, with Judith Plouviez, in East Anglian Arch., 3 (1976), 64, gave the probable grid ref. as above.<br />S. Archer, in The End of Roman Britain, BAR 71 (1979), 45, no. 29, and Cathy E.

M Curteis writes: The hoard contains coins ranging in date from radiates of the late 3rd Century to late 4th century Theodosian bronze issues. There are very few coins earlier in date than 383 while the latest issues were minted c.395-402. The hoard contains a single silver coin (a siliqua of Arcadius). Many of the Valentinianic coins are worn and have been cut down to a similar module as the Theodosian bronzes. It is probable that many of the earlier coins were in circulation, and became incorporated into the hoard, because they had a similar small module to that of the coinage of the late 4th century. The inclusion of a single silver coin is highly unusual and may indicate that the bronze coins were seen to have a monetary value at the time of deposition. The relative proportion of coins with reverse legend SALVS REIPVBLICAE (c.388-402), along with the presence of at least ten coins minted after c.395 would indicate that the hoard is very late, falling right at the end of the Romano-British coin sequence. It may be significant that the hoard was found c 1km further down the side of the Welland valley to another hoard, the Tinwell hoard (DCMS 2000, 118-9). Although the Tinwell hoard was somewhat earlier (having been deposited c 275) and was mainly composed of base-silver radiates (2829 radiates and one base-silver denarius), the proximity may not be accidental and raises the possibility that both hoards form part of a series of votive deposits on religious sites that concentrate in this area, perhaps symbolically marking the boundary between the Corieltauvi and Catuvellauni (Curteis 1996 and 2000).","5/6/2021 11:06:31 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10602","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10602","11/23/2024"

Gaskell, of Kiddington Hall, was in possession of a hoard of bronze coins which had been found at a previous date no more than a few hundred yards from the site of the villa.

Bob went to the same farm with his detector, and got permission to search.<br />He found 300 coins, mostly bronze, but one silver. Bob was told he could keep the coins. He gave half to the farmer, and sold most of the others for over Â£300. He gave the money to Save the Children Fund and Cancer Research.<br />That was three years ago. Now Bob has a new metal detector, much more powerful. He decided to try it out in the same field. He could hardly believe it when he was lucky again. This time he found 36 bronze coins, which again he'll sell in aid of charity. And he's convinced the field hasn't yielded all its treasure.<br />How the coins got there is a mystery.

The thirty-six fully or partially identifiable Constantinian nummi appear to form a typical small discrete hoard of AD 317-48, and a further fifteen illegible late Roman base metal coins have been assigned to the hoard, although without any certainty. It is impossible to judge whether any of the pre AD 317 material is part of the hoard, although this is a possibility as some Constantinian hoards such as the recent Grassmoor (CHRB XII) contain tiny quantities of earlier nummi and even debased radiates. Interestingly a much worn Ibero-Punic bronze of Gades (Cadiz) was also recovered, which nevertheless had a patina similar to the hoard coins. While this may have been a much earlier deposit, the size of the coin is very close to the smaller module nummi and it is not impossible that it was a late antique rediscovery pressed into service.","5/6/2021 11:06:52 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10696","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10696","11/23/2024"

From the descriptions it is clear that they were all reduced folles of the Constantinian period. Unfortunately the details of the legends are somewhat muddled and none of the coins appears to survive, so it is impossible to check them. However, it is reasonably certain that the coins all fall within the period 322-26 AD and that the mints of London, Trier and Arles are represented. Thus the date of the pot, or at least its last use, is fairly well-established.<br />The money-box itself (Fig. 6) is in a grey-black sandy fabric with a black, burnished surface. The globular body is topped by a small finial, presumably a plug of clay used to seal the neck. A small circular fracture can be seen on the finial near the coin-slot, representing either ancient surface spalling or a junction for a handle; no lower attachment for a handle can be seen however, so its existence is extremely doubtful. The vertical coin slot is formed by what appears to be a saw-cut in the neck some 20 mm long, widened by punching or chiselling. This secondary widening may perhaps represent the finder's attempt to extract the coins. It is impossible to gauge the thickness of the walls except at this point. The base is string-cut and maximum height is 115 mm, maximum diameter 102 mm.""<br />-A.J. White, in Britannia, XII (1981), 302f., fig. of pot<br />-A.J.

The site lies on the farm of the Messrs. Thomas, west of a small, deep valley known as Pant y Coed, at Llanbethery, a hamlet of Llancarfan parish in the Vale of Glamorgan, near Barry. Traces of a Roman building have since been noted nearby (Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies, XVII (1958), 294, and fig. 1).<br />The upper part of the vessel, and an unknown number of coins, had evidently been ploughed off during the fourteen years or so in which the very poor field concerned has been cultivated. The yellow clay and stone forming the surface of the bedrock lies only a few inches below ground-level, and the pot was buried upright in a small hollow scooped in the subsoil. In all, 814 coins were recovered, 767 of them in the pot. Sundry other coins are in private hands, but it is not very likely that they would alter the picture now presented. Except for six worn 'radiates', the coins fall within the period c. AD 313-46, and mainly between 330-5. There are very few later than 335, and it seems reasonable to suppose that they were added to the collection when it was to be buried.""<br />The 814 coins were 6 ant., and 808 small AE:<br />Ant.

R Abdy writes: Aside from the unusual nummus fraction from the reign of Diocletian and four 330-5 nummi (which are in very poor condition making judgement as to whether they are imitations difficult) all the coins in this hoard are of the most reduced Constantinian nummi of 335-48. This, together with the heavy proportion of the two victories type of 347-8 suggests that this hoard may well have been selectively assembled after the cessation of production of this tiny coin in 348, presumably ignoring the larger subsequent Fel Temp Reparatio types. Hoards containing quantities of both the mid-Constantinian nummi and Fel Temp coins are known.","5/6/2021 11:07:04 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10765","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10765","11/23/2024"

The soil round it was noticeably dark and, together with the confined area of discovery, strongly suggested that the coins had been dropped or deposited in a purse or covering which had since perished.<br />Subsequent to the deposition of the hoard, the floor of the room had been repaired. Patches of poor, whitish cement were inserted into cavities in the pavement to bring the floor to an even surface with the broken edges of the original mosaic. One such patch completely sealed the hoard, which was only discovered upon the careful removal of the cement.<br /><br />The hoard consists of 1,646 coins, fragments of coins, and pieces of corroded bronze. For purposes of description, it has been somewhat arbitrarily divided into nine categories""<br />AE<br />1. clippings of normal or 'semi-barbarous' copies of Constantinian third brass, rev. types not later than AD 360 16<br />2. clippings of recognizable frags. of 'barbarous' imitations of similar fourth-century coins 132<br />3. minimi, average diameter 7 1/2 mm, diademed 99<br />4. minimi, average diameter 6 mm, diademed 352<br />5. minimi, average diameter 3 1/2 mm, mostly diademed 643<br />6. minimi, average diameter 2 1/2-3 mm 147<br />7. frag.s of coins and minimi 14<br />8. coins of varying denominations with holes or pit marks in them 60<br />9. broken pieces of metal, some quite obviously from coins, others unintelligible 183<br /><br />1646<br />All certain obverses are diademed.

There were several overstrikes.<br />""The Temple-settlement was founded within forty-three years of the severance of Britain from Rome; during that short period of time it was elaborated and, in accordance with the standards of the time and place, attracted considerable wealth; it later decayed, and not until the process of decay had reached an advanced stage was our hoard deposited. It is, in my view, difficult to compress the whole of this varied sequence of events into the three decades of the fourth century. We are, I think, compelled on archaeological grounds to carry the deposition of the hoard into the fifth century into which, as we known, again from archaeological evidence, the occupation continued. On the other hand, the hoard, as is shown by its cement covering, was deposited during the continuous history of the site and is not a subsequent intrusion.""<br />Mrs. Tessa V. Wheeler, in Research Rep. Soc. Ant., IX (1932) 116-31, figs, of coins; introducing the word 'minimissimi' to describe the smallest minims.)<br />G.C. Boon, in 'The Roman Temple at Brean Down, Somerset, and the Dating of ""Minimissimi""', in NC, 1961, 191-7, disputed the late dating of the Lydney, 1929, hoard:<br />""The series from the temple ends with eighteen coins, most of them but slightly worn, of the House of Valentinian I. The site was therefore probably deserted by c. 380.<br />A feature of the Brean series is the large proportion of the barbarous imitations.<br />The main bulk is composed of copies ranging from 16 mm to 3 mm in diameter, and there is also a number of more or less plain minims - 'fallen horseman derivatives' - from 6 mm to 2 mm across. In all, thirty-two separate specimens, or 17 per cent, are 3 mm or less in diameter, and fall therefore within the Lydney category of 'minimissimi'.<br />Extravagant claims have been made as to the date of such coins.<br />Dates as late as the mid-sixth century have been put forward, and a shortage of bronze in sub-Roman times has been adduced to account for the tiny module of the coins. This is entirely unwarranted archaeologically. It is unfortunate also that the internal evidence of the Lydney hoard, the evidence of its associations, and that of stray finds of 'minimissimi' elsewhere on the site were not urged more strongly in the original report. As Kent has recently pointed out, nothing in the orthodox coins [i.e. from the Lydney Temple] is later than 360, although the Lydney site in general - founded 364 abounded in coins of the House of Valentinian..<br />Two suggestions can be made. The first is that the use of the term 'minimissimi' should cease; it is imprecise and, in fact, has been abused; moreover it suggests the existence of a shadowy 'denomination' for which there is no warrant in our present state of knowledge. Secondly, in view of the striking corroboration of Kent's thesis, attempts to discern copies with perhaps radiate obverses paired with 'fourth-century' reverses, or any attempt to link barbarous copies chronologically with the earliest Saxon issues of sceattas - in short to suggest that copies of the type here discussed, or any other type, circulated beyond the limits of the monetary crisis which called them forth, seems ill advised in the extreme.""<br />Lydney, 1929, hoard on loan to Ashmolean Museum, Oxford<br />Examined 473 coins, 1978 (ASR)"" ******* The 183 fragments of metal includes some coin fragments and others that may be classed as objects, but all have been counted as coins here.Full discussion of groups with av. weights by Wheeler 1932.","5/6/2021 11:05:26 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10240","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10240","11/23/2024"

Unfortunately this letter, which might have usefully supplemented other accounts, cannot be located.<br />It should be noted that two of the coins were released by the Museum for destructive analysis when the hoard was accidentally dispersed among unprovenanced examples in the old collections. Dockets stating this appear in envelopes marked 'Constantius I. Gloria Exercitus' and 'Constantius II. Gloria Exercitus'. In neither case do these tally with a list of the eighteen coins sent for analysis, though there are several of the correct period covered by the other coins listed above.

A variety of western mints are represented, though there is a clear bias towards the nearer mints of London, Trier and Lyon. There are only a few coins from the eastern mint of Sisica. The final coins of the group were produced between AD 316 and AD 317.","5/6/2021 11:07:24 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10858","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10858","11/23/2024"

The hoard or hoards had been buried within a ditch filled with occupation debris including a range of pottery. Undisturbed ditch fill between the two holes made by the finders and their report of the position of the stones, suggest the two groups of coins were originally buried separately rather than the smaller group simply being the upper part of the main group turned over by the plough.

One point that makes the second hoard almost certain is the lack of wear on these coins of Valentinian I and his co-rulers.

The relative lack of clipping fits the pattern of a hoard of this date. However the presence of the above mentioned coin makes it difficult to date the deposition of the hoard precisely. It appears to be of a slightly later type (AD 395-402) and could have been deposited well into the fifth century after a long period of circulation. The difference in the degree of clipping of this coin and the others in the group suggests that they were deposited some time before this. It may therefore be that this later coin is a stray find and not part of the main hoard. In addition to the silver coins, there are two nummi, one of small module contemporary with the hoard and another of larger module slightly earlier than the group. Mixed hoards of nummi and siliquae are not unknown (for example the Bishops Cannings hoard, which had a large proportion of bronze, and Hoxne, which contained a few smaller module bronze coins mixed in with the siliquae). It is therefore not inconceivable that the larger module bronze coin was also either part of the hoard or associated with the same pattern of deposition at this site. The fact that the hoard was found near a spring points to a votive or ritual context for this deposition.Treasure detailsTreasure case tracking number: 2012T196

(The total of coins of Honorius in the 1980 hoard was given as 16 instead of 17, although 17 were actually catalogued, making a total of 155)..<br />""This table shows that the 1978 hoard cut off sharply after 388 (except for six coins of the late 390s from the Milan mint) and consequently had no [sic] clipped coins. The 1980 hoard however is rather later, and is typical of some of the latest Roman silver hoards from Britain with a lot of Milan coins and a large percentage of clipped coins. Although the practice of clipping cannot be certainly dated, it suggests a date in the second decade of the fifth century for the deposition of the 1980 hoard.<br />The presence of the six later coins in the 1978 hoard makes the precise relationship of the two hoards acute: the six were clearly added several years after the bulk of the hoard was deposited, and as they are the sort of coins so plentiful in the 1980 hoard it is tempting to think that they might have been added by the owner of that hoard.

The hoard was found in a field north of both the pressent and the former line of the A27 approximately 0.5 km south-west of the village of Patching, West Sussex. When the hoard was discovered the field was under rough pasture.... The twenty-three gold coins recovered by the metal-detectorists were found in three stages. The first sweep produced five coins. Subsequently, using a mini-digger, the metal-detectorists recovered a further seventeen gold coins, twenty-five silver coins, two heavy gold rings, and a quantity of silver bullion. Archaeological excavation revealed that three trenches had been dug by machine, at the request of the metal-detectorists, to a depth of nearly 0.5m. A final gold coin was subsequently found by the metal detectorists after the archaeological excavation had been completed.... Excavation revealed no original context for the coin and bullion hoard. The discovery of two field-drains below the main concentration of coins suggests that the hoard may have been disturbed by one, or both, of the operations to set these drains.... The following sequence can therefore be suggested: (1) Original deposition of the hoard in unknown receptacle or pit. (2) The construction of the nineteenth-century field-drain disturbs the concentrated hoard, with artefacts redeposited during backfilling. (3) The scattered hoard is disturbed a second time by the laying of the later field-drain, once again with redepositing occurring during backfilling. (4)Upper layers disturbed by excavations by metal-detectorists... The nineteenth-century disturbance of the hoard could have resulted in the discovery of two of the solidi which then appeared later in Chichester [see single finds, Chichester]. AD 367-75 (1)<br />1.

The coins were stuck together on the under-side of a flat stone in spoil mechanically excavated in 1940 when the face of the inner rampart on the west and south sides of the camp was scarped to render it tank-proof in the event of an invasion. In 1940 or 1941, a coin of identical type had been found at the same place by Ian Ellis, and he now estimates that during these years he and several others must have found at this spot a total, including the bulk discovery, of about 120 coins, all of similar type. The uniformity of the collection leaves no doubt that it formed part of a single hoard, but what proportion it may represent of the total originally hidden is quite uncertain.<br />The circumstances of discovery make it probable that the hoard was concealed at or near the base of the forward scarp of the inner rampart or perhaps in the near side of the ditch itself, which had already become nearly filled up by late Roman times. No special reason can be suggested for the choice of site for concealment, but the slope below the east rampart has been known, through a number of discoveries during the hundred years since the making of the railway cutting and tunnel, as the site of a Roman cemetery serving the inhabitants of Durnovaria; and some undefined activity in or near the camp itself in the early fourth century AD was attested by the excavations in 1939.'""

There had evidently been occupation within this (although a trench encountered no foundations) - probably a wooden building on analogy with Ditchley; and the pottery in the ditch was first-century, with abundant Belgic types. Into the filling of this ditch, or rather in a cleared-out portion of it (since no grave dug through the filling could be detected in the section), the two burials had been deposited, the upper on his back with no grave-goods, the lower on his left side with the coins. Two coins, one silver and one bronze, were enclosed between two thin silver-foil discs folded over each other in the mouth; the other coins (seven) were all together in a compact mass high up against the ribs, a fact which suggests the previous existence of a bag or purse slung round the neck.

These were probably erected within the years AD 275 and 296.<br />The evidence of the finder is to the effect that the coins, though found in a mass, were unaccompanied by any trace of purse, box or other container and showed no sign of having been secreted in a hole in a wall or in thatch. The corrosion of some of the coins and traces of wood-fibre (?) on them suggest possible burial in a box with iron bands.<br />The site on which the coins were found seems to have carried a hut, with a foundation course to its walls of large rough pieces of Folkstone stone.

In Area C3, rectangular stone Building i was aligned E-W &amp; 15 x 7m in size, with clay bonded walls with loosely dressed faces.

These 2 structures may have been agric. buildings assoc. with a larger complex - Building j could have been a byre. During excav., however, controlled metal detecting &amp; archaeol. recording around the two buildings plotted concs. of coins &amp; brooches, with a particular focus on the NE corner of Building i, but also with groups to the N 7 SE; &amp; to the E of Building j. The coins &amp; brooches were sometimes individual but also in groups of c. 10-16 coins, which in several cases were spatially close to brooch finds. The coins &amp; brooches were sometimes in soil layers, sometimes in very shallow 'scoops' in underlying natural subsoil.

However it is possible that this deposition happened in spatially separate areas but at the same time, over an extended long period.In Mays' coin report in the excavation volume (pp. 126-134), Mays identifies 9 groups of third and fourth century coins (A-I) from Area C3 that were found in dense scatters over radius of c. 0.15m. It is suggested by Mays that these might be votive deposits, or alternatively hoards, but she suggests that only 4 of these scatters would fit conventional ideas of a hoard, due the larger than usual number of radiates, so the former explanation is more likely. She comments that ""the spatial distributions of neither the broken nor the unbroken brooches corresponds to that of the coins"". However the figure (Fig. 55) seems to suggest otherwise. She does link the human skull fragments to this deposition.The coin groups are: Scatter A - 16 coins to AD 364-378; Scatter B - 9 coins to AD 388-393; Scatter C - 16 coins to AD 388-402; Scatter D - 13 coins to AD 367-378; Scatter E - 4 disparate coins to AD 367-375; Scatter F - 9 coins to AD 367-378; Scatter G - 5 coins to AD 364-375; Scatter H - 5 coins to AD 337-341; &amp; Scatter I 6 coins to AD 341-348.

TAR 2002, 209; NC 2003, 18.Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2002 T295NotesAmongst a group of coins shown to members of the archaeological team by a metal detector user during the course of the filming an episode of the Channel 4 television programme Time Team. The coins were recovered over a number of years whilst metal detecting at Sedgefield, County Durham. The coins shown included a group of six siliquae, which were reported by the finder to have been found in close proximity to each other. The coins were not submitted to any museum for examination and it was not possible to record any weights. Several of the siliquae were clipped. A written report expressing the opinion that the coins represented a hoard that had been deposited post AD 410 was submitted to HM Coroner. The coins were found at inquest not to be Treasure and returned to the finder. In addition to the parcel of siliquae, the finder showed 40 denarii and 35 large imperial base metal coins. These were stated to have been found scattered over a very wide area in an adjacent field (25 acres). Unusually, no radiates or base-metal coins of fourth century date were reported. The coins were once again examined in the field and it was not possible to record weights. The copper-alloy coins were poorly preserved and most displayed identical pitted and corroded surfaces. They were thought not to have been a hoard on the basis of the wide area but have been recorded at the British Museum.Full lists of the other groups of coins by Craig Barclay are held at the Yorkshire Museum.Subsequent actions

It also showed the bank to have been a substantial one and the ditch 9 feet wide at the top and more than 4 feet deep. The bottom of the ditch was not reached and nothing was found in it or the bank, but in a depression near the top of the bank Mr. W. Flux, the gravel-digger who first noticed the sherds and coins found a large part of an undoubted Roman bowl, which goes to show that the bank is not later than the Roman period. Eastward of the bank a terrace of the original soil had been left by a previous gravel-digging, and it was from the thin layer of earth here that the bulk of the finds came. They include potsherds, a lump of lead, rings, a buckle and a socketed knife or sickle of iron, and 22 coins, mostly fourth century, with two worn survivals from the second.

It dates to the early part of the reign of Octavian (later Augustus), 31 BC - AD 14 and could have been a regular part of the Romano-British coin circulation up until the early part of the second century AD. However, very occasional evidence from other finds of late Roman coins (e.g. the fifth century Patching hoard from Sussex and the fourth century Beaurains hoard from Arras in northern France) shows that such denarii from the Republican / early Imperial period sometimes survived into later periods - presumably kept for their silver content as the denomination would no longer have been familiar so long after the discontinuation of denarius production (in the third century AD). Other ancient material was found within a 30 ft area and this has been recorded by the PAS (including ceramics, a brooch and other copper alloy objects).

The possibilities remain (a) that they form a hoard concealed in the gravel make-up and scattered by the delving of the squatters, or (b) that they represent a hoard formerly concealed in the super structure of the building and later scattered by falling, or (c) that they are unconnected with the building, and were either dropped casually by the squatters or collected by them for reworking, or finally (d) that they are purely residual relics whose presence is entirely fortuitous..<br />If, however, the coins were not a hoard but casual losses, it would be a sad coincidence, indeed, had the builders happened to drop as many as seven coins and all in the one part of the nave which was later destined to be disturbed. Could a hoard have been concealed somewhere in the superstructure of the building, later to fall and be scattered in the hollow? This is archaeologically speaking a possibility.

Floors, where present, consisted of trampled chalk.<br />Within the building there were six furnaces built of Portland stone, two of them slight semicircular structures; the other four were well-constructed and large - 1.50 m. long, surviving to a height of 60.0 cm.

The deposit from Oven 4 has been included here separately in IARCH-E0A2E2, although the specific number of coins from that context is not known, but Cooke considers them as one hoard.According to Cooke (2007, 7) ""However, using the published coin list (Patrick Greene 1993, 93), it is possible to suggest the likely composition of this hoard. In order to do this, only coins recovered from rubble contexts or those recovered from within oven 4 (see above) have been included. This excludes all the coins recovered from topsoil deposits (some of which may relate to the hoard) but does allow us to examine those coins most likely to be part of the hoard. Using these criteria, a minimum of 304 coins can be suggested as belonging to the hoard""It is not possible to give a precise reconstruction of the number of coins from each period from the graph in Cooke's figure 3 (2007, 17) as the figures are not given. However c. 175 of the coins are attributed to the House of Theodosius and the remainder are mostly fourth century or unidentified 3rd to 4th century coins, with a small number of late third century coins.N.B.

There were then 95 sil., accompanied by labels for 99 sil., and a drawing of the little pot, of buff-coloured coarse ware, with a heavy roll rim. The hundredth sil., and its label, were missing.<br />Regarding the findspot he observed that ""With the aid of the description of the find, already quoted, and a Belvoir manuscript plan of the area in the hand of William Mounsey<br />it is possible to fix the find-spot of the hoard with tolerable accuracy.<br />The coins were found at the west side of the road from Saltby to Sproxton, five yards from the hedge and 570 yards north of Sproxton Church, half-way up a slight natural rise in the ground. On the other side of the hedge was 'the appearance of an old Stone-pit', which had recently been partially filled in by the freeholder, Amos Ewen, with earth taken from what Mounsey considered to be a tumulus, situated a few yards farther north at the top of the rise. As mentioned above, the bones found at the same time may more probably be connected with this tumulus or adjacent burials than with the coins. Mounsey notes that 'there has been no alteration of the Earth in the memory of man where the Coins were found, and less inequality of the ground on that side of the Fence'.""<br />B.H.St.J. O'Neil identified the 95 sil., and listed the 4 sil. represented only by labels:<br />Sil. Sil.

King, in BNJ, 51 (1981), 9, 15, 18f., 21f., gave nos. of clipped coins which do not quite correspond with B.H.St.J.

They were found in March, 1824, at Terling Place, near Witham, Essex, with a large hoard of gold and silver coins. The discovery occurred under the following circumstances: some workmen were engaged in forming a new road through Colonel Strutt's Park, and, the earth being soaked by heavy rains, the cartwheels sunk up to their naves. The driver of the cart saw some white spots upon the mud adherent to the wheels, which he imagined to be small buttons: at that moment Colonel Strutt's steward came to the spot, and perceived coins upon the wheels. Not fewer than 300 were picked up at that time. Three days after, Colonel Strutt's steward made further search, and found a small vase, almost perfect, in which had been deposited the two gold rings, and thirty aurei, of the size of a guinea, with several silver coins, all as bright as if recently struck. Several other vases, in which no coins or other objects were found, lay near the spot; they crumbled to pieces on removal; the perfect vase was carried to Terling Place.""<br />The 2 gold rings, 30 solidi, and 304 of the silver coins were also taken to Terling Place, where they were kept, along with two bronze coins, which were apparently found at the same time and place.<br />J. Talbot, in AJ, III (1846), 162f., list of coins, figs. of rings<br />In 1933, Lord Rayleigh allowed B.H.St.J. O'Neil to consult manuscript letters describing the find, and to re-examine and re-publish the pot and coins. Mr. O'Neil concluded that the hoard had consisted of a pot of silver coins, which had originally numbered 300-400, and a pot of gold coins numbering 30, along with the two gold rings, while the 2 bronze coins may have come from a Romano-British habitation site in the neighbourhood. The pot which had contained the silver coins had been smashed by the cart wheels.<br />The pot which contained the gold coins was a small jar of hard, fine red ware, 3 1/4 in. high and 2 3/4 in. wide, covered with a lighter red-brown slip. The interior surface was grooved. On the upper part of the pot was a graffito I/VTVXYII.<br />One of the gold rings was about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was made of a thin strip of gold, ornamented with gold wire. The oval bezel was of paste, with an engraved design which is now too worn to identify. The other gold ring was also about 3/4 in. in diameter, and was formed of a flat strip of gold, ornamented with beaded and plaited gold wire. The bezel was lost.<br />M. Henig, Corpus of Roman Engraved Gemstones from British Sites, BAR 8 (1974), ii, 94, no. 724, described the details of the rings as follows: ""Ear of corn. Very schematically represented. Nicolo paste. Surface worn and indistinct. 15 by 13 mm. Flat, Oval<br />Another ring set with a colourless crackly crystal of Paste, uncut and en Cabochon.<br />""<br />The coins preserved at Terling Place were 26 solidi, and 296 sil. 4 solidi and 8 sil. having been lost since 1824.<br />Sol.

O'Neil's lists."" ******* Dating from Bland and Loriot (latest coins either 404 or 407-8). The eyewitness accounts quoted by O'Neil (1933 146-7) would seem to suggest that the silver coins were found in one pot (not recorded) and the gold and finger rings in another (the pot drawn and described). A possible organic container is also hinted at; ""some part of the Earth appears as if it had been wood perished from time laying in the Earth"" (R. Ellis quoted in O'Neil 1933, 147).Note that other vessels were found at the findspot and that two bronze coins were assumed not to have been part of the hoard (they were a small Urbs Roma type of Constantine I mm TRP and an unidentifiable radiate).Coins in original find listed in Archaeological Journal 3 (1846) p. 162 as follows:""The gold coins comprised eight of Valentinian, one of Valens, one of Gratian, nine of Arcadius, and thirteen of Honorius. The silver pieces were thus enumerated ; Constantius, ten; Julian, not<br />laureate, one ; Julian, twenty-three, including one bearing a second head; Jovian, one ; Valentinian, twenty-one ; Valens, forty-three ; Gratian, thirtyeight; Magnus Maximus, thirty-six; Victor, five; Valentinian, junior, five; Eugenius, seventeen; Theodosius, twenty-seven; Arcadius, forty-five; Honorius, thirty ; with two silver coins, uncertain, and two of bronze, ranging from about A.D. 335 to 445.""","5/6/2021 11:05:20 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10222","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10222","11/23/2024"

The coins were found in a compact mass in a single spade-full of soil; there was no sign of a container. At a Coroner's Inquest held at Thetford on March 6, 1979 the hoard was found to be Treasure Trove..<br />The coins are all silver siliquae. The majority are in excellent condition, but are slightly worn, indicating that they were in circulation for only a short period of time..<br />The findspot was just south of one of the barrows on Gallows Hill, which was excavated by Andrew Lawson of the Norfolk Archaeology Unit in 1978 and 1979. Evidence from these excavations shows that the Roman land surface was higher than the present surface in the area so that the hoard was probably at a depth of perhaps a foot, close to a prominent land-mark. The coins were found as a compact mass, and had almost certainly been buried in a container of organic material, such as wood or leather which, because of soil conditions, had failed to survive.""<br />The 47 sil. were:<br />Trier Lyons Arles Rome TOTAL<br />Constantius II 5 4 9<br />Julian II, Caes. 1 1<br />Julian II, Aug. 2 10 6 18<br />Valentinian I 1 1<br />Valens 8 1 9<br />Gratian 3 3<br />Theodosius I 2 2<br />Magnus Maximus 4 4<br /><br />19 15 11 2 47<br />Barbara Green, in Norfolk Arch., 37 (1979), 221-3; list of coins based on list by A.M.

This can, however, be regarded only as an approximate date for the hoard's burial, as it had a very weak end (compared with the heavy concentration of issues struck under Julian) and coins of the few years after 388 are rare.

The coins, comprising three gold solidi and six silver siliquae (one being a contemporary counterfeit), were scattered over an area of several hundred square feet. No trace of any associated container was recovered. The earliest coin recovered is the a siliqua of Constantius II, issued c.AD 353-55. With the exception of a cliche imitation siliqua in the name of Gratian (AD 367-83), all the other coins can be attributed to the reigns of Arcadius (AD 383-408) and his brother and co-emperor Honorius (AD 393-423). Of these the latest coin struck is the Ravenna mint solidus of Honorius, which was issued c.AD 402-06. All of the coins are of types which would have been in circulation at the time of the withdrawal of direct Roman rule from Britain in AD 410. Indeed the four of the officially issued siliquae (# 6-9) are badly clipped, suggesting a date of deposit for those coins of AD 410 or slightly later. The archives of the Yorkshire Museum record the donation to the museum in 1834 of a gold solidus of Honorius (#3) found on the same site .This raises to four the number of late Roman gold coins from the site, and suggests that the coins under consideration may well represent survivors from a hoard which had been initially disturbed by 1834. The wide distribution of the coins may well accordingly be the result of 150 years of ploughing and natural soil erosion, a suggestion supported by the clear evidence of plough damage visible on two of the three solidi recovered by Mr Charlton. The coins found [...] were declared to be Treasure Trove at an inquest held in Richmond on 18 February 1998 and were subsequently acquired by the Yorkshire Museum. ******* Images in C&amp;M The 1834 solidus was included in the published hoard catalogue although it is not known whether the provenance was given to the museum beyond the parish level.

The 9 uncertain siliquae are fragments.R. Abdy (unpublished catalogue) writes: ""The latest coin is not fully legible but probably takes the hoard just into the joint reign of Honorius and Arcadius. If so this sole specimen would place Thruxton near the beginning of the sizable body of British siliqua hoards, which end with the period 395-402. Furthermore, the siliquae in this hoard are virtually unclipped ('clipping factor 1' just possible on one specimen) and this, together with the presence of miliarenses alongside the siliquae, supports an earlier date for the deposition of the hoard, before the AD 395-402 coinage had much chance to spread into the circulation.""2016 addenda of 7 miliarenses and 18 siliquae, giving a total of 78 coins (2016T568) included here.2020 addenda of 2 miliarenses and 18 siliquae included here NotesIARCH duplicate record.Subsequent actions

The 9 uncertain siliquae are fragments.R. Abdy (unpublished catalogue) writes: ""The latest coin is not fully legible but probably takes the hoard just into the joint reign of Honorius and Arcadius. If so this sole specimen would place Thruxton near the beginning of the sizable body of British siliqua hoards, which end with the period 395-402. Furthermore, the siliquae in this hoard are virtually unclipped ('clipping factor 1' just possible on one specimen) and this, together with the presence of miliarenses alongside the siliquae, supports an earlier date for the deposition of the hoard, before the AD 395-402 coinage had much chance to spread into the circulation.""2016 addenda of 7 miliarenses and 18 siliquae, giving a total of 78 coins (2016T568) included here.2020 addenda of 2 miliarenses and 18 siliquae included here  ******* IARCH duplicate record.","5/6/2021 11:07:40 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10935","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10935","11/23/2024"

While excavating with a mechanical grab, the find was revealed high up in the sand cliff. It consisted of about 30 lbs. weight of bronze coins contained in an earthenware pot, over which had been placed a second larger pot. Above it lay an ironstone slab, to mark the burial place of the hoard. Unfortunately in the mechanical operations the pots were smashed and the coins (estimated at something over 3,000) were scattered and dispersed. Through the efforts of Mr Tom Gardner, the Ampthill archaeologist, and Mr. C. Bunker, the pit foreman, with their helpers, 2,050 coins and fragments of pottery were recovered. A remarkable feature of all the coins was their mint-fresh condition, the features of the emperors, the details of the reverses, the inscriptions, and mint-marks being clear and clean-cut. By the kindness of the owners, Messrs. Inns &amp; Co., the find is to reside in Luton Museum, probably one of the largest, if not the largest, collection from a single hoard in this country [sic].""<br />-'Nicolas', About it and About, in Beds. Mag., 8 (1961), 73<br />JRS, LIII (1963), 136 (inf. from Mr. T.H. Gardner), gave the find-spot as ""in the sand-pit Â½-mile N of Tingrith"", the number of coins as ""possibly 4,000"", and added: ""Of 2,050 coins recovered 995 were from the London mint and 752 from Trier; the date of deposition was c. AD 337.""<br />In Nov. 1988, Dr. R. Holgate, Luton Museum, provided photocopies of a long article on the circumstances of discovery of the hoard, and on its composition (T.H. Gardner, in Manshead Mag., 13 (1964), 28-30); together with photocopies of the relevant entries in the Accessions Register of Luton Museum (Acc. no. 73/62).<br />The additional information in T.H. Gardner's article included the fact that ""the spot was marked with a piece of ironstone roughly cut to the shape of a diamond"" and that ""about three feet from the hoard, and on what would have then been the surface of the ground, was found the remains of a cooking pot associated with burnt soil and fire-stained stones, which can be taken as evidence of a meal of sorts at the time of burial"". He also noted that most of the coins from the Trier mint were virtually uncirculated, were in rouleaux of the same type and issue, and so suggested evidence of hoarding direct from the mint.<br />The material from the Tingrith hoard, acquired by Luton Museum in 1962, included fragments of 2 pots, one containing the hoard and the other inverted over it; the marker stone; earth samples; calcined sand; the base of a pot found 3 ft. from the marker stone; and 1995 AE coins, from Maximinus Daza (1) to Theodora and Helena (rev. PAX PVBLICA)."" ******* Trier coins reported uncirculated and in rouleux. Not all the coins were recovered but the find was about 30lb in weight. The bulk of the hoard ends at 337-340 but there are two coins listed as 346-350 by Lockyear from the portion in private ownership (no further details as to whether these are considered strays).

The few coins still adhering to the pottery fragments, when they arrived at the British Museum, and the coin stains on those fragments suggest that there was no distinction between the two lots: at any rate both larger and smaller coins were present in each container.

    64Coin data quality rating: Excellent (Grade 4)Description1669 nummi to 351 and pottery. NC 2011.Treasure numbers associated with this hoard: 2010 T082Other PAS records associated with this hoard: WILT-2A47C0Notes(by L. Kaumanns) All 1605 legible coins composing the Warminster Hoard are of the Constantinian dynasty except for one Mag-nentian coin (no. 343), the latest coin, which can be assigned either to AD 350 or 351 (i.e. before the elevation of Decentius). If the hoard dates to the aftermath of the usurpation of Magnentius the absence of other coins with his name could be either explained by the avoidance of his issues (in this case the coin may have come into the hoard accidentally) or there were other Magnentian coins amongst the illegible coins or fragments which could not be identified. Another explanation could be that this coin may not belong to the hoard, but is a stray find from the vicinity (as mentioned above). The two earliest coins are from AD 318-329 (no. 1 and 2). One of them (no. 2) is the only coin of Licinius. The majority of the coins, 1268, were minted between AD 330 and 335. 43 of the Constantinian coins were minted after AD 340 (between AD 346 and 348).Subsequent actions

Thin, matt, and variable in colour, ranging from dull brownish-orange, through brown to blackish and purplish shades.<br />Form. The body is almost globular and has no footring. There are two light grooves on the shoulder, which has a very slightly angled profile. There is now no trace of a handle, but a small handle could have been attached to the area of the shoulder which is now lost.<br />The vessel is clearly a product of one the Nene Valley potteries, and the fabric accords well with manufacture at or near Stibbington, Hunts., in the late third or early fourth century. A globular jug of slightly earlier date (mid third century) from Stanground Park Farm shows some similarities to our vessel. It has a profiled foot and rouletted decoration on the body, but the very rounded shape is similar, and it is likely that the vessel from Warsop also had a short, narrow neck and a small handle.

A pottery bowl, covered by a lid, was found to contain a bronze bowl (used as a liner), two pieces of folded silver plate, remains of a linen-lined leather purse, and 30 Roman gold coins.<br />The pottery bowl (rim diameter 15.8 cm) is burnished on the exterior and has a dark grey to black surface. The upper part of the body is decorated by double lines in zig-zag pattern, enclosing in each triangle three impressed roundels. The style has been called 'Romano-Saxon'. The 'Castor Box' lid (diameter 21.7 cm) is a typical Nene Valley product.<br />The bronze bowl (diameter 13.5 cm, height 9 cm) is of thin sheet bronze and consists of an upper band riveted to a lower part, formed from one piece of metal. Two handles were found inside it, loose, but their original points of attachment are marked by patches of solder. The two pieces of folded silver plate weigh respectively 642 gm and 321 gm. The linen purse lining is in plain weave.""<br />The 30 coins, all solidi, fell into 3 groups:<br />1. 4 coins of the last years of the reign of Constantine I, and his three sons, Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans, as Caesars, up to AD 337.<br />2. 3 coins of AD 337-40, of the joint reigns of Constantine II, Constantius II and Constans, as Augusti.<br />3. 22 coins of AD 340-50, from the death of Constantine II until the revolt of Magnentius in the west brought the reign of Constans to an end.<br />""The final piece, making up the total of 30, is a contemporary forgery of a solidus of Constans from the mint of Trier. The coin is up to standard as far as weight is concerned, but is betrayed as a copy by the style of the obverse portrait and a small blunder in the inscription on the reverse.""<br />The 30 sol. were:<br />Sol.<br />Constantine I 1<br />Constantine II, Aug. 1<br />Constantius II 10<br />Constans 18<br /><br />30<br />(1 as Caes.)<br />(2 as Caes.; 1 contemporary copy, as Aug.)<br />Catherine M.

It consists of 212 silver siliquae of the period 360 to 402 AD. Three facts however point to a rather later date of burial, perhaps as late as the decade 410-20, after the death of Constantine III. The first is the fact that 107 coins, over half of the find, are VIRTVS ROMANORVM pieces of Arcadius and Honorius from the mint of Milan, which were struck between 395 and 402 and are the latest siliquae to enter into circulation in Britain in any quantity. The second is the relatively high proportion of clipped coins (65 or 30.7%), and the third is the comparatively large number of contemporary forgeries (10) which are fairly scarce. R.A.G. Carson has argued that clipping, a phenomenon unique to Britain, does not become widespread until after the supply of new coin had dried up, after the downfall of Constantine III in 411.""<br />The 212 sil.

    353Coin data quality rating: Fair (Grade 2)DescriptionA hoard of 353 Roman copper alloy coins discovered in 1990 and declared as Potential Treasure Trove. The coins are believed to be nummi, and one has been identified as an AE 3/4 of Constantine II (317 - 340 AD). They were found in a ceramic vessel; a black burnished ware pot now in 20 pieces glued together. The coins do not appear to have been catalogued.The hoard was acquired by Clifton Park Museum, Rotherham on the 29th September 1990.Other PAS records associated with this hoard: SWYOR-78C8E4NotesPossible addenda to hoard 2548?

This area is generally known as the Frome Gap. The entrance to the site lies in the northern side of the valley and is some 9 m below the valley lip.<br /><br />The cave revealed evidence of counterfeiting in the Constantinian period, comprising some 200 coins, fragments of coins, droplets of bronze, and sections of cast rod.

Univ. of Bristol Spelaeological Soc., 13 (1972), 61-9<br />""The location of the material was very carefully recorded by Mr. Barrett, and, as he makes plain, the deposits in the cave had at some time been thoroughly turned over, so that post-medieval pottery and a clay pipe-stem lay beneath some of the Roman objects. The 'reversed stratification' points to there having been well-demarcated periods of occupation or frequentation of the cave. Most of the numismatic material relates to counterfeiting but, as Mr. Barrett observes, there is nothing to prove that the counterfeits were actually produced on the spot. There are no crucibles from which metal was poured to make the little bars described: no debris of the clay moulds which must have been used: nothing resembling a die. It is his suggestion that the evidence of counterfeiting was merely concealed in the cave. On the other hand, such preliminary work as was required to produce the blanks may have done elsewhere, perhaps as part of a perfectly ordinary and legitimate bronze-smithing activity; and the dies might have been too precious to leave in the dampness of a cave.""<br />The material was classified as follows:<br />Itemised:<br />A.

The leather immediately mouldered away on exposure to the atmosphere; and the silver urn, which glittered at the first disclosure to the air, assumed an earthy hue; or, as the boy himself expressed it 'all eazed [i.e. decayed] away together'. The Urn is said to have been broad like a bason with an ornamented circular edge turned downwards. The whole treasure weighed two stone. Most of this treasure was soon after transmitted to the lawful owner, the Earl of Aylesbury, on whose estate the discovery was made. Of the silver ornaments, I can, therefore, speak with no certainty. The spoon had a very short inverted handle, and was deep and broad; when perfect, apparently about an inch and a half in length, and near an inch broad. One of the bars of silver was three inches long, three-fourths of an inch broad, and three-eighths thick; the surface very irregular and apparently hammered. Many of the coins towards the top of the Urn (which was, I believe, open) had mouldered into dust, and the ground was actually tinged with a blue colour where they had lain; those in the interior were many of them very perfect; all those I have seen were of the Lower Empire, and of the following emperors: Constantius, Julian, Valentinian, Valens, Gratian, Valentinian the younger, Theodosius, Magnus Maximus, Eugenius, Arcadius, and Honorius. There were no uncommon reverses; but I saw some double denarii, and one of Eugenius. I saw altogether in different hands about 150 coins, chiefly well-preserved, but several of them clipped at the edge.<br /><br />The above account was communicated to me chiefly by the Rev. Wm. Deacon, Vicar of Whorleton, who obliged me by making several inquiries upon the subject.""<br />R. Surtees, in Gent.

This type of grave is typical of one of the Romano-British period. A description of the find of the coins, given to me later by an onlooker at the time, stated that they were in a mass in a hole filled with dark earth dug into the clay and lying close to and on the west side of the human bones. The hoard thus appears not to have been in a container of any sort and that it was not part of the original interments.""<br />The den. of Constantius II and the mil. of Julian II are in Dept. of Coins and Medals, BM (BM Register of Coin Accessions, March 1969), and the silver ring in the Dept. of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities, BM.<br />The other 54 sil., are in Cheltenham Art Gallery and Museum. ******* Coins BM 1969,0303.1- One skull lay to the south, indicating a pagan burial, but details of the burials were difficult to determine.

Greenaway of Reading Museum), added that the hoard contained 1,800 fourth century coins, and that Matthewsgreen was on the north-west outskirts of Wokingham.<br />""Circumstances of discovery<br />The first few coins from the Wokingham hoard were discovered on 20th May 1970 by Mrs P Prime when exercising her dogs in a ploughed field at Matthewsgreen Farm on the north-eastern edge of Wokingham. Subsequently, a more thorough surface search by Mr and Mrs Prime later that evening revealed more coins. On 21st May, 141 coins and 5 sherds of pottery with green corroded material adhering to the inner surfaces were brought to Reading Museum for identification. On 26th May, further coins, making a total of 271 in all, and more sherds, including one with a coin-shaped corroded stain on its interior surface, were deposited at the Museum. It was immediately apparent that the coins and some of the sherds were part of a hoard deposited in a pottery vessel which had been broken and some of its contents scattered by the plough a small excavation was undertaken to recover the rest of the scattered coins and sherds, and, if possible, to locate the remainder of the vessel and its contents. To ensure that no coins or other small metal objects were missed, the sieved soil from the excavation was spread on a plastic dustbin-lid and tested for metal using a metal detector. The bottom part of the pot was located the same day still containing a large proportion of the coins A total of 1610 whole coins, 3 coins in two pieces and a small strip of bronze were found The deposition of coins in the pot seems to have been fairly random: coins of different types and emperors are distributed amongst the stratification of the hoard within the beaker as outlined above. There was no deposition of coins by date, type and emperor. The small strip of bronze was found in the pot..<br />The hoard consisted of the following:<br />Ruler Regular % Counterfeit %<br />Constantius II 125 9.94 46 12.92<br />Constans 202 16.07 49 13.77<br />Vertranio 1 0.08 0<br />Magnentius 793 63.09 234 65.73<br />Decentius 135 10.74 26 7.30<br />Constantius Gallus 1 0.08 1 0.28<br />Total 1257 356<br />Jillian A.

The implication is that the hoard had been collected together as so much scrap-metal rather than as money awaiting better days"". About a quarter of the coins were encrusted with lead carbonate. Nearly a quarter of the hoard was deemed to be counterfeit. Could be later in date due to presence of FTR copies, though these are good weight.","5/6/2021 11:07:09 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10784","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10784","11/23/2024"

The hoard was located on 8 Oct. 1967 by Mr. W. Frost, an employee of Mr. W.R. Marsh of Lodge Farm, who is a tenant of the Earl of Rosse. On 16 Oct. R.M. Butler and J. Radley of RCHM, York, excavated the area and recovered the bulk of the coins and their container.<br />The coins were enclosed in a fourth-century jar of a black calcite-gritted fabric, 9 1/2 ins. High. The jar was upright and protected by part of an inverted large gre-ware jar and a capstone 18 x 11 x 3 ins. The hoard appears to have been inserted into a bank adjacent to a yard, represented by a black horizon full of bone, sherds and charcoal at a depth of 9-12 ins. The yard was presumably adjacent to a settlement which, situated on the Magnesian Limestone, would have been on a well-drained arable area overlooking the Vale of York.<br />Underlying the coins at the bottom of the pot was a quantity of creamy yellow powder which has been analysed by Dr. M. Kapel, Leeds University, and which proved to have a powdered limestone base with traces of silicates, chloride, phosphate, and iron which probably gives the colouring. Thirty-seven of the coins which were encrusted with this powder have been left as they are, without it being possible to identify and classify them.""<br />Then came a summary list of 3247 coins, 1 ant.

XIV of irregular copies<br />The hoard of 1551 coins, at first on loan from Windham Hughes to the Ashmolean Museum, was later presented to the Museum, where it was exhaustively analysed by Dr. Cathy E. King.<br />""Milne's published account of the hoard's contents listed 1,551 coins. When the hoard was recatalogued 1,565 pieces were counted. It is uncertain whether the additional fourteen coins were part of the hoard or modern intrusions although in view of Milne's careful listing of the contents by period and by mint the latter seems more likely. Regrettably it is impossible on physical grounds to distinguish the extra coins which may have found their way into the hoard as none can be obviously excluded on the basis of wear, patina, etc. One can, however, thanks to Milne's method of recording the hoard, identify by mint and period the discrepancies between his totals and the new figures. Thus where Milne recorded five radiates, the hoard now has 6; and there are 10 more coins from Lyons than appear in his totals (which included the copies, listed by him as genuine issues). The totals from Arles, Rome, and Heraclea all have one more coin than Milne noted, Cyzicus has one less, and the remaining extra piece belongs in the group of uncertain mintmark.""<br />Cathy E.

Report by Steve Critchley: The hoard itself comprised a dispersed scatter of 38 coins from the lower fills of a pit, 339, on the northern margin of the pond (Figs 5 &amp; 6, Section 15; Table 6). These were also in poor condition, and only eight can be specifically attributed. They range in date from a coin of Constantine I (330-346) to coins of Valens (364-378). This suggests that the hoard was probably deposited at some time in the 370s AD, but it contained some issues 30-40 years old at the time. The presence of a single coin of Gratian (367-383), found elsewhere on the site, may suggest that occupation continued for only a few years after the deposition of the hoard.","5/6/2021 11:07:25 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=10865","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/10865","11/23/2024"

The number of coins in the jar was very great, probably amounting to 5,000. All of these that I have seen were of copper, and most of them exceedingly shabby.

In the dirt stuck to the wheel, he found several silver and copper coins, which he picked up. He handed over the silver coins to Torgsyn in the early 1930s, and he kept the copper coins. On April 29, 1937, he handed over one copy to the Central Historical Museum (now the National Museum of History of Ukraine). Among the silver coins, according to the owner, were coins with the image of a woman's head.

Near the amphitheatre.//  Archaeology site comment: In classical antiquity, it was inhabited by the Histri, a Venetic or Illyrian tribe recorded by Strabo in the 1st century AD. The Istrian peninsula was conquered by the Romans in 177 BC, starting a period of Romanization. The town was elevated to colonial rank between 46–45 BC as the tenth region of the late Roman Republic, under Julius Caesar. During that time the town grew and had at its zenith a population of about 30,000. It became a significant Roman port with a large surrounding area under its jurisdiction. During the civil war of 42 BC of the triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus against Caesar’s assassins Brutus and Cassius, the town took the side of Cassius, since the town had been founded by Cassius Longinus, brother of Cassius. After Octavian’s victory, the town was demolished. It was soon rebuilt at the request of Octavian’s daughter Iulia and was then called Colonia Pietas Iulia Pola Pollentia Herculanea. The colony was part of Venetia et Histria, a region of Roman Italy. Great classical constructions were built of which a few remain. A great amphitheatre, Pula Arena, was constructed between 27 BC – 68 AD, much of it still standing to this day. The Romans also supplied the city with a water supply and sewage systems. They fortified the city with a wall with ten gates. A few of these gates still remain: the triumphal Arch of the Sergii, the Gate of Hercules (in which the names of the founders of the city are engraved) and the Twin Gates. During the reign of emperor Septimius Severus the name of the town was changed into ""Res Publica Polensis"". The town was the site of Crispus Caesar’s execution in 326 AD and Gallus Caesar’s execution in 354 AD.

From the second half of the 1st century AD J.-C., the establishment develops considerably.This first phase of villa, with multiple annexes, covered nearly 5,000 sqm. Two wine cellars were built on the southern parts. To the north, its residential part appears rather luxurious. A propitiatory deposit, composed of a plate and an urn containing two coins, was discovered there.There were many constructions phases between the end of the 3rd century and the beginning of the third century AD. The villa covered more than 1 ha.To the north, the residential part of the estate covered over 2,500 sqm. The northern wing, presumably built on a podium, was equipped with a portico. During the first half of the 4th century, an axial reception room was added. Two new wine cellars, in which casks or barrels were placed and a probable grain store, are built to the south of the villa.To the east, other annexes, poorly preserved, are located around a new courtyard. Their function has remained uncertain, perhaps, warehouses.In the 5h century, the villa turned into a more modest building. Many of the previous buildings were destroyed. The late one was composed of seven to eight units including a potter’s workshop, a forge or a dryer / smoking room. A funeral ensemble was located the northern edge of the site. Towards mid-6th century, most of the buildings were abandoned. Only an unit of 300 sqm was inhabited before being deserted in the middle of the 7th century.","10/23/2022 7:12:23 AM","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/?FindFocusIDs=14127","http://csla100w.princeton.edu:82/CoinFindJson/Index/14127","11/23/2024"

After the reorganization of the empire by Diocletian, Rotomagus became the main town of the divided province of Gallia Lugdunensis II and reached the peak of its Roman development, with an amphitheatre and thermae.

Hittite documents refer to a mountain site of Salawassa in the fourteenth century BC and the town spread during the Phrygian and Lydian cultures. Sagalassos was part of the region of Pisidia in the western part of the Taurus Mountains. During the Persian period, Pisidia became known for its warlike factions. Sagalassos was one of the wealthiest cities in Pisidia when Alexander the Great conquered it in 333 BC on his way to Persia. It had a population of a few thousand. After Alexander’s death, the region became part of the territories of Antigonus Monophthalmus, possibly Lysimachus of Thrace, the Seleucids of Syria and the Attalids of Pergamon. The archeological record indicates that locals rapidly adopted Hellenistic culture. The Roman Empire absorbed Pisidia after the Attalids and it became part of the province of Asia. In 39 BC it was handed out to Galatian client king Amyntas, but after he was killed in 25 BC Rome turned Pisidia into the province of Galatia. Under the Roman Empire, Sagalassos became the important urban center of Pisidia, particularly favoured by the Emperor Hadrian, who named it the ""first city"" of the province and the center of the imperial cult. Contemporary buildings have a fully Roman character. Around AD 400 AD Sagalassos was fortified for defense. An earthquake devastated it in AD 518 and a plague circa AD 541-543 halved the local population. Arab raids threatened the town around 640 and after another earthquake destroyed the town in the middle of the seventh century, the site was abandoned.

The Roman settlement was identified via the mansio Hadriani, a second century BC post office located at the point where via Popillia, coming from Rimini, headed for Adria, whereas a coastal route went on to Loreo in later times. Between late 4th and early 5th century AD, San Basilio was the site of a Paleochristian community; a cathedral with a baptistery was built, which is still visible in the archaeological area open to the public. A small necropolis with inhumation burials was also connected to the church. As for the church, only the perimeter wall and the southern part of the apse facing east have been identified, and therefore the current state of research cannot define its layout. The baptistery is of the type with octagonal layout and central basin and apse on the eastern side; it was connected to the church perhaps via some arcades, which must have been functional to the complex rituals of baptism. A large monumental building datable to the Roman Empire (2nd-3rd centuries AD) can be seen in the archaeological area.

The city was founded in 720 BC by Achaean and Troezenian settlers. Sybaris amassed great wealth thanks to its fertile land and busy port. In 510/09 BC, the city was subjugated by its neighbor Kroton and its population driven out. Sybaris became a dependent ally of Kroton, but Kroton again besieged the city in 476/5 BC, probably resulting in another victory for Kroton. Two attempts to reoccupy the city failed around 452/1 BC and 446/5 BC when the remaining Sybarites were again expelled by the Krotoniates. After a call for help the Sybarites reoccupied their city later in 446/5 BC with the assistance of new settlers from Athens and other cities in the Peloponnese. This coexistence did not last long: the Sybarites got into a conflict with the new colonists and were ousted for the last time in the summer of 445 BC. In sum, the city saw a total of five periods of occupation separated by expulsion. The new settlers then proceeded to found the city of Thurii in 444/3 BC, a new colony which was built partially on top of the site of Sybaris. The surviving Sybarites founded Sybaris on the Traeis.

It was located on Mediterranean coast, at the western border of the territory of the Masaesyli, a Berber tribe. Their traditional opponents were the Berber confederation of the Maesulians, who ruled the eastern portion. In the course of the Second Punic War, the king of the Masaesyli, Syphax, allied himself with the Roman Republic, and the armies led by Scipio Africanus, while the Maesulians, ruled by Masinissa, sided with the Republic of Carthage. With the defeat and capture of Syphax by Masinissa, the western tribes were conquered and gradually absorbed into a united kingdom under his rule. After a temporary decline, the city got some importance inside the Roman Africa, especially with African emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla. With the Arab conquest, during the second half of the seventh century, disappeared all references to Siga in documented history.

During the civil war between Pompey and Julius Caesar, G. Considius Longus secured Hadrumetum for the Optimates with forces equivalent to two legions. Despite being reinforced by Gn. Calpurnius Piso’s Berber cavalry and footmen from Clupea, however, he was obliged to allow Caesar to land nearby on 28 December 47 BC. Caesar’s attempts to negotiate with Longus were rejected but the campaign subsequently led to his victory over Metellus Scipio and Juba at Thapsus, after which Longus was killed by his own men for the money he was carrying and the town went over to Caesar. Hadrumetum was an important source of Rome’s grain supply. Hadrumetum revolted while Vespasian was proconsul of Africa. It nonetheless continued to prosper; Trajan gave it the rank of a Roman colony, giving its residents Roman citizenship. It was the second city in Roman Africa after Carthage and the birthplace of Clodius Albinus, who attempted to become emperor in the 190s. At the end of the 3rd century AD, it became the capital of the new province of Byzacena. In AD 434, it was largely destroyed by the Vandals. A century later, Hadrumetum was retaken and rebuilt by the Byzantines during the Vandal War. It was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate in the 7th century.

It was located on the confluence of the Crna River(Erigon) and the Vardar (Axios). The Stobi theater was probably built in thefirst half of the 2nd century AD. Starting with Emperor Vespasianus, allthrough Caracalla, there had always been а mint in the city. Monumentalpalaces, temples, thermae etc. were built with аn urban physiognomybased upon the Hypodamos’ scheme of cardo-decumana, in the mostbeautiful Hellenistic-Roman tradition.During the Late Antiquity, in the second half of the 4th century andthe first half of the 5th century, the Stobi Antique Theater was definitely out ofuse. Due to the increasingly frequent invasions апd raids by the barbarians,there was а need of building stone for the renewal of the city, paгparticularly forits fortification (the construction of the Stobi internal city rampart). Thus, thecity theater was transformed iпto а quаrrу and its architectonic plastics wasincorporated above all, in the stylobates of the numerous early Christianbasilicas built in that time.""//  Archaeology site comment: ""It was found in the North-East corner of the V Room, in the substructure of the stage, 0.50 m. below its level, between а pillar and the Eastern perimetral wall of the theatre.""//  Rating comment: ""The coins were most probably kept in а leather bag, and the indirect exposure to atmospheric influences resulted in metal damage.

It was occupied continuously for 700 years from about 300 BC. There is evidence of sporadic settlements dating back even further, perhaps to 2000 BC or before. From the 1st century BC and during the Gallo-Roman period, foundations of masonry replaced the earlier, less durable constructions. These, together with the 9-m high earthen ramparts around the periphery, clearly demonstrate the importance of the Celtic oppidum which appears to have been the seat of the Treveri chiefs. While there is evidence that the site was probably inhabited as far back as 2000 BC, the beginnings of urban civilization can certainly be traced back to the 2nd century BC when there were bronze-working shops at the site. In the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD, the oppidum had become a civilized community trading with other Gallic centres. The Treveri nobles appear to have occupied the dwellings at the centre of the plateau. The Celtic tombs excavated in the vicinity, specifically at Clemency, at Scheierheck near Goeblange and at Kreckelbierg near Nospelt contain a range of articles including wine flagons, spurs, knives, lances and oil lanterns testifying to the aristocracy of those buried. The entire site was originally surrounded by 10 m high, reinforced ramparts, sometimes called a Murus Gallicus, with fortified doors at either end of the road through the site. The ramparts were later largely removed by the Romans except at the SE end where they can still be observed. A deep ditch, 4 m wide, perpendicular to the road, separated the residential space from the public space. The residential area covering about 30 ha consisted of rectangular houses, 14 m long by 8 m wide, built of light masonry. They were equipped with fireplaces and sometimes ovens. In the public space, the remains of a large hall, 14 m square, have been found. This could have been a meeting place for political or religious purposes. About 20 years after the Roman conquest, the Celtic oppidum was completely reworked and two streets perpendicular to the main were constructed. The houses too were replaced with Roman buildings which had stone foundations and cellars. These were however generally demolished two decades later at the time the Romans moved their centre of interest from Titelberg to Trier. The Treveri, despite one early battle, apparently adopted Roman culture and religion fairly easily. Titelberg, though no longer a capital, became a prosperous vicus with a range of activities, especially metal working. In particular, minting of coins and smelting extended at least until around 337 as one of the coins found at the site of the smelter bears the likeness of Constantine II. In the public area, a square-shaped Gallo-Roman temple was built which was later extended with a roofed porch on all sides.

Built as a defensive work along the Norican frontier, it originally housed an ala of up to 500 cavalry troops (ala I Commagenorum). From its exposed situation, it was able to guard a militarily significant ford over the Danube and control the valley lowlands for a good distance upstream and down. Several phases of rebuilding at the site have been identified: it was established, as an earth-and-timber encampment, in the late 1st century AD, probably under Domitian, and in the early 2nd century stone fortifications were constructed. In its later days the fort served as the base of a naval fleet (the classis Comaginensis), as well as a cavalry regiment (equites promoti). Excavations to the west and south of the fort have uncovered evidence of at least two associated vici (civilian settlements) and three graveyards.

In 157 BC, the city was a de facto Roman centre and was given the name of Vicetia or Vincentia, meaning ""victorious"".The citizens of Vicetia received Roman citizenship and were inscribed into the Roman tribe Romilia in 49 BC. The city was known for its agriculture, brickworks, marble quarry, and wool industry and had some importance as a way-station on the important road from Mediolanum (Milan) to Aquileia, near Tergeste (Trieste), but it was overshadowed by its neighbor Patavium (Padua).During the decline of the Western Roman Empire, Heruls, Vandals, Alaric and his Visigoths, as well as the Huns laid waste to the area, but the city recovered after the Ostrogoth conquest in 489 AD, before being conquered by the Byzantine Empire soon after.

Rebuilt upon the original Histrian pattern, it was a Roman town until 46–45 BC, when the Ancient Greek colony Polai was elevated to Pietas Iulia, today Pula. The town was located on the ancient road Via Flavia, which connected Trieste to Dalmatia. The area was abandoned by the Romans in the 6th century, following the Slav invasions.

It belonged to the Celtic kingdom of Noricum, but under the emperor Augustus added the oppidum to Pannonia, which became a formal province during the second half of the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54). It is at this stage that a subunit of the Fifteenth Legion Apollinaris, which was stationed at Carnuntum, was sent to Vindobona. The first military settlement must have been constructed out of wood, like all forts in this period. During the second half of the first century, it was occupied by several mounted auxiliary units, like an Ala I milliaria from recently conquered Britain. Late in the first century, probably in AD 89, the emperor Domitian transferred the Thirteenth legion Gemina from Poetovio (modern Ptuj in Slovenia) to Vindobona. War had broken out on the Lower Danube, and Rome needed additional forces in Pannonia to fight against the Dacians and their allies. The soldiers of the Thirteenth constructed the legionary base of circa 18.5 hectares. During Marcomannic wars, Vindobona was sacked. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius defended the Danube frontier and was able to seize the initiative. Vindobona was rebuilt and seems to have offered accommodation to the headquarters of the imperial forces. Marcus Aurelius died on 17 March 180 died in Vindobona. In the first half of the third century, Vindobona was rebuilt again. In AD 212 received the tile of municipium. This was the beginning of the settlement’s golden age, which continued after 260, when the Germanic tribes became aggressive again. The fortress was an important bulwark against the northern enemies, and the imperial forces were reinforced. In ca. AD 395, Vindobona was sacked again by Germanic warriors of the Marcomannic tribe, and again, the civil and the military settlement were rebuilt, although probably on a smaller scale. In the first decade of the fifth century, a fire destroyed the fortress. The settlement now also boasted a naval base for the Classis Histrica. Alans and Ostrogoths gradually infiltrated the civil settlement, and the soldiers of the fortress were often recruited from these tribes. In AD 433, the East-Roman emperor Theodosius II allowed the Huns to occupy Vindobona. At the beginning of the sixth century, Pannonia and the city of Vindobona were taken over by the Langobards, and in AD 568, by the Avars, who were ultimately defeated by Charlemagne.

""In one room, close to the putative toilets discovered in the second season, a sitting bathtub was found. This room has two parts: the eastern part is triangular in shape, while the western is trapezoidal. A passageway, serving as the entrance to the bathroom and to a a room located in the south, was found to the south of the bathroom. In the passageway, which like the bathroom was originally paved with a mosaic floor, is a sink. Two coin hoards were found in this area in 1987. In the first were 48 coins; 255 specimens were in the second. Most of them date from the first half of the fourth century CE"" (Meyers et al. 1990, 222).//  Rating comment: The report is forthcoming, D.T.
